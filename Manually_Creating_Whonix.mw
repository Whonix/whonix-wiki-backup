This is just a '''draft, unfinished!''' Just some ideas. Unlikely to be ever finished. For special setups and advanced users only. Only in case the [[Download]] version, [[Other Operating Systems]], [[Dev/Build_Documentation/Physical_Isolation|Physical Isolation]] or [[Dev/Build Documentation]] instructions are not suitable, for example if you like to use another distribution as the base for {{project_name_gateway_long}}. [[Dev/Build Anonymity]] has not been considered.

This assumes {{project_name_short}} 7 or above.

[[Dev/Source Code Intro]] contains a source code introduction.

Look into {{project_name_short}} source code. It is mostly an installing and copy and paste task.

Look into the source file ./build-steps/45_create-vbox-vm. See function general_setup to see which commands are used to create both Virtual Machines, apply hardware_modifications on both machines, and also apply gateway_specific or workstation_specific accordingly.

After installing the operating system...

* Packages listed in /home/user/{{project_name_short}}/development/{{project_name_gateway_short}}_packages have to be installed on {{project_name_gateway_short}}.
* Packages listed in /home/user/{{project_name_short}}/development/{{project_name_workstation_short}}_packages have to be installed on {{project_name_workstation_long}}.

All files within whonix_gateway folder are configuration files supposed to be installed on {{project_name_gateway_short}}. For example /home/user/{{project_name_short}}/whonix_gateway/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf is supposed to be installed on {{project_name_gateway_short}} under {{Code2|/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf}}.

All files within whonix_workstation folder are configuration files supposed to be installed on {{project_name_workstation_short}}. For example /home/user/{{project_name_short}}/whonix_workstation/usr/local/bin/xchat-reset is supposed to be copied to /usr/local/bin/xchat-reset on {{project_name_workstation_short}}.

whonix_shared are configuration files supposed to be installed on {{project_name_gateway_short}} and {{project_name_workstation_short}}. For example /home/user/{{project_name_short}}/whonix_shared/etc/sudoers.d/whonix is supposed to be copied to /etc/sudoers.d/whonix on {{project_name_gateway_short}} and {{project_name_workstation_short}}.

You don't have to bother with most other files in {{project_name_short}} source folder. <ref>Those are used for image creation and Virtual Machine creation. </ref> Just read README and LICENSE.

Chroot Scripts...

* /whonix_gateway/usr/share/whonix/chroot-scripts-pre.d are run inside {{project_name_gateway_short}}
* /whonix_workstation/usr/share/whonix/chroot-scripts-pre.d are run inside {{project_name_workstation_short}}
* /whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/chroot-scripts-pre.d are run inside {{project_name_gateway_short}} and {{project_name_workstation_short}}
* There are also chroot-scripts-post.d folders.

You can also read the scripts and only run the commands you find sensible manually one by one.
