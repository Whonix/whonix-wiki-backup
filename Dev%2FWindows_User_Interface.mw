= Introduction =

The [[Dev/Windows Installer|{{project_name_long}}-Windows-Installer]] was designed as a simple and fast way to set-up {{project_name_long}} on a system running Microsoft Windows.

To make using {{project_name_long}} after the installation as convenient as possible <code>{{project_name_long}}-Windows-User-Interface</code>, more simply <code>{{project_name_short}}.exe</code> is provided. It is a small C# based launcher for {{project_name_long}}.

{{project_name_long}}-Windows-User-Interface will be installed when installing {{project_name_long}} on Windows using {{project_name_long}}-Windows-Installer.
