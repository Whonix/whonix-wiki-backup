=== Overview ===
* Contracts with larger payments attract a greater internal priority to fulfill the customer's request.
* Customers with a higher prioritization can expect to receive faster and more comprehensive replies.
* Terms and conditions are subject to change under certain conditions.
* The quality of support may vary at times when the team has a heavy workload.
* Work samples which verify the quality of support are demonstrated in [https://forums.{{project_clearnet}}/users/patrick/activity public {{project_name_short}} forum activity].
* Answers are provided in the forum.

=== Solution Probability ===

There is no guarantee that a solution can be found for every issue. Prior experience suggests problems related to the wide range of topics already covered in the [[Documentation]] have a higher chance of resolution, and within a shorter time frame.

=== Billing ===

Charge backs are not possible. For payment options, see [[Payments]].

=== How to Buy Plus Support ===

1. Choose a relevant payment option and make the [[Payments|payment]].<br />
2. The customer is eligible for plus support for a period of 30 days after the payment is made.<br />
3. E-mail Patrick with proof of the payment and submit your question. The proof of payment must include the customer's full name, the transaction ID, country of tax residence.<br />
4. Depending on the customer's internally assigned priority, the timeliness and comprehensiveness of the reply may vary.
