Take careful note of the following issues when using standard, common http(s)/SOCKS4(a)/5 proxies -- anonymizers that only use http(s)/SOCKS4(a)/5 as an interface <ref>Like the Tor, or [[I2P]] software.</ref> are exempt.
* Most problems with these proxies are not caused by {{project_name_short}}.
** These problems are [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]].
* Tor exit relays and their ISPs can still monitor your connection to its destination.
* Be especially careful with http(s) proxies. Some of them send the [[Whonix_versus_Proxies#Summary|<code>X-Forwarded-For</code>]] header which discloses the IP address. http(s) proxies that do not send this header are sometimes called "elite" or "anonymous" proxies.
* When using <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> http(s) proxies, destination servers can determine the IP of your Tor exit relay.

For further detailed information on proxies, see: [[Whonix_versus_Proxies|Tor vs. Proxies, Proxy Chains]].

== Comparison of Post-Tor Proxy Connection Methods ==
There are three different methods to connect to Tor before a proxy.

! Examples
| Tor Browser proxy settings; foxyproxy
| torsocks; proxychains
| iptables; redsocks
|-

! Application requires no support for proxy settings
| {{No}}
| {{Yes}}
| {{Yes}}
|-

! Likelihood of leaks <ref>
TCP or DNS
</ref> going <code>user</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code>
| Depends <ref>Depends if the application has any proxy bypass bugs.</ref>
| Depends <ref>Depends on how bug free the socksifier is.</ref>
| style="background-color: {{Green}}"| Lower <ref>Because redirection happens at the iptables level, not at the application level.
</ref>
|-

! Leak-shield possible in theory 
| {{No}}
| {{No}}
| {{Yes}}
|-

! DNS can be resolved by the same proxy
| {{Yes}}
| {{Yes}}
| Needs extra DNS resolver <ref>
See [[Tunnels/Connecting_to_Tor_before_a_proxy/Transparent_Proxying_Method#DNS_resolution]].
</ref>
|-

! Does not need separate DNS server.
| {{Yes}}
| {{Yes}}
| {{No}}
|-

! Per application configuration required
| {{Yes}}
| {{Yes}}
| {{No}}
|-

! System wide configuration
| {{No}}
| {{No}}
| {{Yes}}
|-

! Proxy chains possible
| No
| Yes, but see footnote. <ref>
Questionable if that adds anything. See: [[Whonix_versus_Proxies#Proxy_Chains_Introduction|Aren't 10 proxies (proxychains) better than Tor with only 3 hops? - proxychains vs Tor]]
</ref>
| No, would require custom development. <ref>
Would require adding a proxy chains feature to redsocks.
</ref>
|-

! Setup difficulty
| Very difficult because different settings required for every application.
| Initial setup very difficult. Afterwards similar usage for most applications.
| Initial setup very difficult. Afterwards easy and reliable leak-shield.
