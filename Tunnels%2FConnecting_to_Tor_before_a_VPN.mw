Instructions on how to connect to Tor before a VPN.

'''<code>User</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>VPN</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code>'''
}}
= Introduction =
Whonix users have the option to use a VPN but in most cases it's not needed and there are other alternatives. Reading the [[Tunnels/Introduction]] wiki page beforehand is advice to learn more if using a VPN with Whonix is useful or harmful.

By design, a VPN routes all your applications -- those without any proxy settings -- through the VPN. This may be undesirable as explained below; for example, it increases the threat of identity correlation. To circumvent this possibility, only use this {{project_name_workstation_long}} for particular applications that should be routed through the tunnel-link. Refer to the [[Multiple Whonix-Workstation|Multiple {{project_name_workstation_long}}]] wiki chapter for further instructions.

{{Tunnels_Introduction}}

= Security Precautions =

== Prevent Bypassing of the Tunnel-Link ==

{{Prevent_Bypassing_the_Tunnel-Link}}

{{Anchor|Fail_Closed_Mechanism}}

== Use a Fail Closed Mechanism ==

{{Fail_Closed_Mechanism}}

Instructions below include a fail closed mechanism.

== VPN Client Choice ==

* It is recommended to utilize OpenVPN.
* Using [https://bitmask.net/en Bitmask VPN] for this use case is not possible. <ref>
https://0xacab.org/leap/bitmask-vpn
</ref> In other words, you cannot use <code>user</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>bitmask</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code>. <ref>
Previously Bitmask did not support Tor. Broken link: <nowiki>https://github.com/leapcode/bitmask_client/issues/1009</nowiki>
</ref>
* Other VPN clients are [[unsupported]].

= Set Up Tor before a VPN (User &rarr; Tor &rarr; VPN &rarr; Internet) =

== Introduction ==

Two configurations are available:

* [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_long}}]] users have the option of <u>either</u> using
** '''A)''' [[#Separate VPN-Gateway|Separate VPN-Gateway]], <u>or</u> alternatively could also use
** '''B)''' [[#Inside {{project_name_workstation_short}}|Inside {{project_name_workstation_short}}]] instructions.
* [[Non-Qubes-Whonix|{{non_q_project_name_short}}]] users should prefer [[#Inside {{project_name_workstation_short}}|Inside {{project_name_workstation_short}}]] instructions.

== Separate VPN-Gateway ==

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Platform specific notice.

* [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_short}}]]: Functional in principle but potentially broken due to Qubes bugs. See below.
* [[Non-Qubes-Whonix|{{non_q_project_name_short}}]]: [[Unsupported]].
}}

This configuration has a separate VPN-Gateway between {{project_name_gateway_short}} and {{project_name_workstation_short}}: <code>{{project_name_workstation_short}}</code> &rarr; <code>VPN-Gateway</code> &rarr; <code>{{project_name_gateway_short}}</code>.

<code>User</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>VPN</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code>

There used to be a Qubes specific bug breaking this. <ref>
* https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/7123#issuecomment-1245292312
* https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/7261#issuecomment-1242979914
* https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-core-agent-linux/blob/master/network/setup-ip
* in short: Contents of <code>/usr/lib/qubes/setup-ip</code> need to re replaced with [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QubesOS/qubes-core-agent-linux/master/network/setup-ip <code>setup-ip</code>]
</ref> It has probably been fixed at least since Qubes R4.2. Please try and report if this worked for you so this notice can be removed.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' <u>Prerequisite knowledge:</u> '''Qubes VPN Setup over Clearnet'''

"Forget" about {{project_name_short}} for a moment for this step 1. This is about Qubes only. This is [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]].

The user needs to master setting up the VPN-Gateway as per [https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/configuring-a-proxyvm-vpn-gateway/19061 Qubes VPN Documentation] in context of a "normal" VPN using clearnet. Meaning, without involving, mentioning {{project_name_short}} in any way. Connection scheme: <code>User</code> &rarr; <code>VPN</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code>

It is recommended to follow the [https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/configuring-a-proxyvm-vpn-gateway/19061#set-up-a-proxyvm-as-a-vpn-gateway-using-iptables-and-cli-scripts-5 ''Set up a ProxyVM as a VPN gateway using iptables and CLI scripts''] instructions because this prevents clearnet leaks if/when the VPN breaks down.

Two options. Choose one.

* '''A)''' If intending to use <code>Qubes-vpn-support</code>:
** Note regarding [https://github.com/tasket/Qubes-vpn-support Qubes-vpn-support]: See [https://github.com/tasket/Qubes-vpn-support/issues/72 Qubes-vpn-support broken in Qubes R4.2] status.
* '''B)''' If not using <code>Qubes-vpn-support</code>: No special notice.

<u>Note:</u>

* <u>UDP:</u> UDP-style VPN connections are incompatible with Tor because it requires the VPN to be configured to use TCP. <ref>
See [[Tor#UDP|UDP]].
</ref> This requires adding <code>proto tcp</code> to the VPN configuration file <code>/rw/config/vpn/openvpn-client.ovpn</code>. Nearly all VPN providers support this configuration.
* <u>Support:</u> Please do not contact {{project_name_short}} support for this step because mastering this skill is specific to Qubes only.

'''2.''' Clone a Template.

For example, clone <code>debian-{{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_version_short}}</code> and name the new template clone <code>debian-{{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_version_short}}-vpn</code>. <ref>
At the time of writing Debian 11 <code>bullseye</code> was the stable release version.
</ref>

<code>Qube Manager</code> &rarr; <code>debian-{{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_version_short}}</code> &rarr; <code><u>C</u>lone qube</code> &rarr; <i><code>Enter name for Qube clone:</i> debian-{{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_version_short}}-vpn</code> &rarr; <code>Press: OK</code>

'''3.''' Create a new ProxyVM based on the newly cloned template.

Name the VM VPN-Gateway and set the {{project_name_gateway_short}} ProxyVM (<code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code>) as NetVM. Make sure to check [✔] the box for "provides network".

{{Box|text=
<code>Qube Manager</code> &rarr; <code><u>Q</u>ube</code> &rarr; <code>Create <u>n</u>ew qube</code>

* Name and label: <code>VPN-Gateway</code> (Set the preferred color)
* Type: <code>Qube based on a template (AppVM)</code>
* Template: <code>debian-{{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_version_short}}-vpn</code>
* Networking: <code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code>
* Advanced:   [<code>✔</code>] Provides network
* Press: <code><u>O</u>K</code>
}}

'''4.''' ''Torified VPN Setup''

Setup the VPN-Gateway. This will be similar to step 1. This will result in connection scheme <code>User</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>VPN</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code> because in above step Networking: <code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code> has been configured.

<u>Notes:</u>

* <u>VPN Provider Choice:</u> A VPN provider different from the VPN provider used in step 1 should be used. This is because the VPN provider from step 1 knows you real IP address. The VPN provider used for connection scheme <code>User</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>VPN</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code> should only know your Tor exit relay IP address.
* <u>Fail closed mechanism:</u> Without configuring a fail closed configuration, all traffic originating from the {{project_name_workstation_short}} App Qube (<code>{{project_name_workstation_vm}}</code>) would <u>only</u> be forced through Tor if/when the VPN connection breaks down (<code>User</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code>).
* <u>UDP vs TCP</u>: Reminder. Only TCP can be used as mentioned in step 1.

'''5.''' Check the VPN-Gateway is fully functional.

Test connectivity from inside the VPN-Gateway as per [https://github.com/Qubes-Community/Contents/blob/master/docs/configuration/vpn.md Qubes VPN Documentation].

'''6'''. ''Recommended:'' Prevent bypassing of the tunnel link.

In {{project_name_workstation_short}} (<code>{{project_name_workstation_vm}}</code>), apply instructions from the [[#Prevent Bypassing of the Tunnel-Link|Prevent Bypassing of the Tunnel-Link]] section.

'''7.''' ''Optional:'' Leak tests.

It is recommended to run the related [[#Leak_Tests|Leak Tests]].

'''8.''' Done.

The VPN-Gateway configuration is complete.
}}

Notes:

* No DNS configuration is required when using a separate VPN Gateway and system DNS should work out of the box. <ref>
This is because a properly configured Qubes VPN-Gateway will be able to resolve DNS.
</ref>
* For troubleshooting, see footnote. <ref>
* Check the VPN-Gateway is fully functional. Test connectivity from inside the VPN-Gateway.
* When testing the VPN connection <u>do not</u> add any VMs that have been previously used for non-anonymous activities behind the VPN-Gateway. This will burn the VPN, making it unsuitable for use with {{project_name_short}}!
* Create a fresh, newly created VM if intending to use a non-{{project_name_short}} VM behind the VPN-Gateway for testing purposes.

The procedure is complete. If you have any issues, refer to the [[#Troubleshooting|Troubleshooting]] section below. Once the setup is functional, it is recommended to perform [[#Leak Tests|Leak Tests]].

= Troubleshooting =

{{VPN-Firewall/Troubleshooting}}

=== How to Submit a Support Request ===

{{VPN/Setup/Support Requests}}

= Leak Tests =

== Introduction ==

It is important to verify the network traffic configuration enforces <code>User</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>VPN</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code> and <u>not</u> only <code>User</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code>. Therefore, it is recommended to run the following related leak tests inside {{project_name_workstation_short}}. Test Tor Browser, a uwt wrapper deactivated application, as well as a regular application for leaks.

== Regular Application Test ==

Use <code>curl</code> without pre-configured [[Stream Isolation|stream isolation]].

<!-- EDITORS NOTE: '{{!}}' is a magic word for '|'.-->
{{CodeSelect|code=
{{Curl_Plain}} --silent {{Curl_Secure}} https://check.torproject.org {{!}} grep IP
}}

<ref name=nodns>
In the absence of functional system DNS, an alternative is to just test TCP.

The IP <code>{{Check.torproject.org_IP}}</code> might change. To discover the current one, run the following command inside a VM with functional system DNS. (Ideally inside a {{project_name_workstation_short}}.)

{{CodeSelect|code=
nslookup check.torproject.org
}}
</ref> <ref>

<!-- EDITORS NOTE: '{{!}}' is a magic word for '|'.-->
{{CodeSelect|code=
{{Curl_Plain}} --silent {{Curl_Secure}} -H 'Host: check.torproject.org' -k https://{{Check.torproject.org IP}} {{!}} grep IP
}}
</ref>

The output should show something similar to: {{Code2|Your IP address appears to be: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx}}<br />
It should also list the VPN's IP address.

== uwt-wrapped Application Test ==

Connect to <code>check.torproject.org</code>.

<!-- EDITORS NOTE: '{{!}}' is a magic word for '|'.-->
{{CodeSelect|code=
curl --silent {{Curl_Secure}} https://check.torproject.org {{!}} grep IP
}}

<ref name=nodns /> <ref>
<!-- EDITORS NOTE: '{{!}}' is a magic word for '|'.-->
{{CodeSelect|code=
curl --silent {{Curl_Secure}} -H 'Host: check.torproject.org' -k https://{{Check.torproject.org IP}} {{!}} grep IP
}}
</ref>

== Browser IP Test ==

This test can be skipped if Tor Browser will not be used through the VPN.

If everything was configured correctly, test the setup. Open <code>https://check.torproject.org</code> in Tor Browser. It will state "{{Code2|You are not using Tor.}}" and the VPN's IP address will be visible. In fact this means the VPN was tunneled through Tor first because {{project_name_workstation_short}} can not make any non-Tor connections by design (everything is tunneled over Tor).

== DNS Leak Test ==

{{DNS_Leak_Tests_Online}}

== Other Leak Tests ==

Advanced users can also run a multiple additional, general leak tests that are unrelated to tunneling. However, these are more difficult to perform and are targeted at developers rather than general users. For further information, see: [[Dev/Leak_Tests|Leak Tests]].
