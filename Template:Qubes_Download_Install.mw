'''1.''' Download both [[{{project_name_gateway_short}}|{{project_name_gateway_long}}]] and [[{{project_name_workstation_short}}|{{project_name_workstation_long}}]] Templates.

In <code>dom0</code>, run. <ref>
The following <code>qubes-dom0-update</code> command is:

* Optional.
* Useful because it has a progress indicator while the subsequent <code>qubesctl</code> command does not. (Qubes feature request: [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/4215 add salt download progress indicator]) It very confusing to have a long running download command with progress bar, specifically over Tor.
* Insufficient by itself - the subsequent <code>qubesctl</code> command that follow is mandatory as per [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/3447 phase out manual use of qubes-dom0-update by user / replace it by salt] and [[Dev/Qubes#salt]].
* <code>--enablerepo=qubes-templates-community</code>:
** <code>--enablerepo=qubes-templates-community</code> can be omitted if Qubes Community Templates Repository is already enabled in <code>dom0</code>.
** Qubes Community Templates Repository should already be enabled as per Qubes default unless disabled by user, restored {{Q_project_name}} from backup or some other edge case.
** Recommending to type <code>--enablerepo=qubes-templates-community</code> is bad usability since users cannot copy from their VM browser where they are most likely reading this to <code>dom0</code>. But too many people reported this issue. [https://forums.whonix.org/t/had-to-enable-community-templates-to-get-new-template/12489 had to enable Qubes templates community repository]
** If Qubes Community Templates Repository is not enabled in <code>dom0</code>, explicitly add <code>--enablerepo=qubes-templates-community</code> or enable through editing dom0 file <code>/etc/yum.repos.d/qubes-templates.repo</code>.

In <code>dom0</code>.

'''1.''' Open file <code>/etc/yum.repos.d/qubes-templates.repo</code> in a text editor with root rights.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo nano /etc/yum.repos.d/qubes-templates.repo
}}

'''2.''' In section <code>[qubes-templates-community]</code>, add the following.

{{CodeSelect|code=
enabled = 1
}}

'''3.''' Save.

'''4.''' Done.

Qubes Community Templates Repository has been enabled. Command line parameter <code>--enablerepo=qubes-templates-community</code> should be no longer required.

'''5.''' Report.

'''2.''' Configure <code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code> and <code>{{project_name_workstation_vm}}</code> safely. <ref>
* Do <u>not</u> interrupt the salt process once it has started or this can lead to an [https://groups.google.com/g/qubes-users/c/fwCqxENXguY unstable system].
* <code>qubesctl</code>: Is a command by Qubes, not {{project_name_long}}. Advanced users could may look at [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/salt/ Qubes salt management stack <code>qubesctl</code>] for further information about <code>qubesctl</code> and Qubes salt.
* If Templates were not previously downloaded already by using above <code>qubes-dom0-update</code> command, then the <code>qubesctl</code> command would also download both {{project_name_gateway_long}} and {{project_name_workstation_long}} Templates.
