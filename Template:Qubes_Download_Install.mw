This downloading procedure can take a long time to finish. Fast Internet connections take only a few minutes, while slow connections can take twenty minutes or more (it is far slower over Tor).

<u>In <code>dom0</code>.</u> <ref>
The following <code>qvm-template</code> command is:

* Optional.
* Useful because it has a progress indicator, while the subsequent <code>qubesctl</code> command does not. (Qubes feature request: [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/4215 add salt download progress indicator]) It is very confusing to have a long-running download command with no progress bar, especially over Tor.
* Insufficient by itself - the subsequent <code>qubesctl</code> command that follows is mandatory, as per [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/3447 phase out manual use of qubes-dom0-update by user / replace it by salt] and [[Dev/Qubes#salt]].
* <code>--enablerepo=qubes-templates-community</code>:
** <code>--enablerepo=qubes-templates-community</code> can be omitted if the Qubes Community Templates Repository is already enabled in <code>dom0</code>.
** The Qubes Community Templates Repository should already be enabled by default, unless disabled by the user, restored {{q_project_name_long}} from backup, or in some other edge case.
** Recommending typing <code>--enablerepo=qubes-templates-community</code> is poor usability, since users cannot copy from their VM browser (where they are most likely reading this) to <code>dom0</code>. But too many people reported this issue. [https://forums.whonix.org/t/had-to-enable-community-templates-to-get-new-template/12489 had to enable Qubes templates community repository]
** If the Qubes Community Templates Repository is not enabled in <code>dom0</code>, explicitly add <code>--enablerepo=qubes-templates-community</code> or enable it through editing the <code>/etc/yum.repos.d/qubes-templates.repo</code> file in dom0.

To download {{project_name_gateway_short}} and {{project_name_workstation_short}}, run this command:

{{CodeSelect|code=

* Do <u>not</u> interrupt the salt process once it has started, or this can lead to an [https://groups.google.com/g/qubes-users/c/fwCqxENXguY unstable system].
* <code>qubesctl</code>: This is a Qubes command, not from {{project_name_short}}. Advanced users may refer to [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/salt/ Qubes salt management stack <code>qubesctl</code>] for further information about <code>qubesctl</code> and Qubes salt.
* If Templates were not previously downloaded using the above <code>qvm-template</code> command, then the <code>qubesctl</code> command would also download both {{project_name_gateway_short}} and {{project_name_workstation_short}} Templates.
