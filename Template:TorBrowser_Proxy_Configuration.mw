Complete the following steps inside {{project_name_workstation_long}} (<code>{{project_name_workstation_vm}}</code>).

'''1.''' Launch Tor Browser.

'''2.''' And enter <code>about:config</code> into the URL bar and press enter.

'''3.''' Change the following settings.

'''4.''' Set <code>extensions.torbutton.use_nontor_proxy</code> to <code>true</code>.

'''5.''' Set <code>network.proxy.no_proxies_on</code> to <code>0</code>.

'''6.''' Proxy specific settings.

Depending on using a HTTP, HTTPS or SOCKS proxy.

'''A)''' HTTP proxy

If a HTTP proxy is being used, modify address and port number to the following strings.

* <code>network.proxy.http</code>
* <code>network.proxy.http_port</code>

'''B)''' HTTPS proxy

If a HTTPS proxy is being used, modify the following strings instead.

* <code>network.proxy.ssl</code>
* <code>network.proxy.ssl_port</code>

'''C)''' SOCKS proxy

This process can be repeated with socks proxies, but it is redundant and does not provide any advantage over the former types. The reason is because only Tor Browser is modified and no other programs are being tunneled through it.

* Set <code>network.proxy.socks</code> to the IP of proxy server.
* Set <code>network.proxy.socks_port</code> to the port number of the proxy server.
* Set <code>network.proxy.socks_remote_dns</code> to
** <code>false</code> - if the proxy server does not support resolving DNS. In this case, DNS will go through Tor exit nodes thanks to {{project_name_long}}, <u>or</u>
** <code>true</code> - if the proxy server does resolving DNS which is better.
* Set <code>network.proxy.socks_version</code> to either <code>4</code> or <code>5</code> depending on the version of the proxy server.

'''7.''' Done.

Tor Browser proxy configuration has been completed.
