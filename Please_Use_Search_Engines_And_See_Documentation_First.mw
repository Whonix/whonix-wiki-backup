{{intro|
To save your own time and be easy on the developer team please, use '''forums internal search function''', '''search engines''', other '''modern tools like AI (Artificial Intelligence)''' and utilize the extensive [[Documentation|{{project_name_short}} documentation]]. Do the leg work first, search for answers to your questions yourself before asking for help - especially for basic questions, as many common issues and solutions are already documented.

= Introduction =

{{Self Support First Policy Short}}

'''To save time please do not ask very basic questions like:'''

* How do I update {{project_name_short}}?
* How is {{project_name_short}} run on Windows?
* How does VirtualBox work?
* How do I do X on operating system Y?

First consider whether someone else has likely raised the exact same question or issue. Experience has shown that most topics have already been discussed within the {{project_name_short}} community and often been documented.

Before asking a question, please first use search engines, modern tools like AI and refer to the [[Documentation]] and research existing threads in the [https://forums.{{project_clearnet}} {{project_name_short}} forums].

We like to notify you of the following popular '''AI services'''.

{{IconSet|h3|!}} '''Note:'''
# We do not endorse any of these services specifically. There are other options available.
# We recommend treating AI tools as "less formal" search engines and NOT as primary sources!
# Always ask AI for primary sources and rely your knowledge and actions on the primary sources, NOT on the AI.
# Keep in mind that AI can hallucinate, so again always verify the information using primary sources.
# [[Policy_On_Artificial_Intelligence|{{project_name_long}} Policy On Artificial Intelligence (AI)]] applies.

= Rationale =

Existing resources should be consulted for several reasons:

* {{project_name_short}} is a technological means to security, but staying safe necessitates complete behavioral change; it is a complex problem without an easy solution. The more you know, the safer you can be.
* Available [[Documentation]] can provide answers to some of these questions.
** [[Documentation]] answers are generally of higher quality than information posted in a casual setting (like forums or chat).
* Some questions/topics are generic in nature and out of scope for {{project_name_short}} -- in these cases the questioner must acquire a basic prerequisite knowledge of computing elsewhere before attempting further procedures.
* The [[Self_Support_First_Policy#Self_Support_First_Policy_Rationale|Self Support First Policy Rationale]] and [[Reporting_Bugs#Policy_Rationale|Support Request Policy Rationale]] apply.

Developers have made significant efforts to configure safe defaults, but operational security (opsec) is not realized by merely using a suitable platform. Staying safe requires a change of mindset and necessary skills are normally developed via trial and effort, experimentation, and general education.

Computing security is complex subject, which means it is improbable that volunteers can assist with every step of the journey and learning curve. Or course advanced questions about {{project_name_short}}  are welcomed, particularly for undocumented use cases. <ref>Time permitting and when developers have sufficient interest.</ref>
