! Keystroke and Mouse Fingerprinting
| Beware of keyboard keystroke and computer mouse-based deanonymization as explained in the [[Surfing Posting Blogging]] chapter.
|-

! Mobile Shell Roaming and Echo
| [https://packages.debian.org/{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}/mosh mosh] might be a useful addition. However, it requires UDP and it is therefore difficult to utilize over Tor, see: [[Tunnel UDP over Tor]]. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_Jd5k0S_AQ Is it safe to mosh?]
