{{project_name_long}} in the cloud - Development Considerations
}}
= Virtualization Technology =
* docker based or KVM based?

= Build Script TODO =
* If docker based:
** create a docker filesystem tar.xz
** dockerfile Whonix-Gateway
** dockerfile Whonix-Workstation
** docker virtual internal networking
* If kubernetes based:
** kubernetes pod yaml
** internal networking?

= Misc TODO =
* preseed [[Anon Connection Wizard]] for non-interactive mode
* systemcheck fixes to support new virtualizer
* [[Dev/Leak_Tests|leak testing]]
* static networking vs DHCP
* DHCP
** needed?
** outside?
** find a security review contractor
* create a cloud-support package which contains cloud specific configuration tweaks

= Cloud TODO =
* cloud interface switch network button
* cloud interface different speed / anonymity choices
* kubernetes switch network

= Anonymizer =
* Working codenames:
** Default Tor (just "normal" Tor)
** Fast Tor (
** Own Tor (self-hosted Tor network)
*** How to stop freeloaders?
* Why Tor?
** Tor supports transparent proxying
** supports nodes config

= legal documents =
* Existing documents can be re-used.

= Sponsorship =
* honest documentation in the usual style what if xyz how secure, less secure, more secure, etc.
* homepage, [[Download]] page gets a <code>cloud</code> button
* main sponsor
* reputation instead of hand waving
* continuous support for future version support
* cooperation agreement
* oversight
* access to developers
* access to tickets
* advisory
* monitor and confirmation of progress

= Secure Cloud Hardware TODO Research List =
