<u>''Optional:''</u> Complete the steps below if you are unfamiliar with GnuPG or if they have not already been performed. This will fix potential <code>gpg: WARNING: unsafe ownership</code> warnings.

'''1.''' '''GnuPG data folder initialization.'''

Initialize your GnuPG user data folder.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --fingerprint
}}

'''2.''' '''File permission setup.'''

Set warning-free permissions.

{{CodeSelect|code=
chmod --recursive og-rwx ~/.gnupg
}}

<u>Expected output on success:</u> '''None.''' Many Linux commands simply perform the action and remain quiet. Unless there is an error, no output is expected. If there is any issue, an error message will be shown.

'''3.''' '''Done.'''

The process of GnuPG initialization is complete.<noinclude>
