Display the key's fingerprint.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --keyid-format long --import --import-options show-only --with-fingerprint {{{source_filename}}}
}}

Verify the fingerprint. It should show.

<u>Note</u>: Key fingerprints provided on the {{project name long}} website are for convenience only. The {{project name long}} project does not have the authorization or the resources to function as a certificate authority, and therefore cannot verify the identity or authenticity of key fingerprints. The ultimate responsibility for verifying the authenticity of the key fingerprint and correctness of the verification instructions rests with the user.

<blockquote>{{{gpg_fingerprint_output}}}</blockquote>

The most important check is confirming the key fingerprint <u>exactly</u> matches the output above. <ref>
Minor changes in the output such as new uids (email addresses) or newer expiration dates are inconsequential.

'''Warning:'''

Do not continue if the fingerprint does not match! This risks using infected or erroneous files! The whole point of verification is to confirm file integrity.
