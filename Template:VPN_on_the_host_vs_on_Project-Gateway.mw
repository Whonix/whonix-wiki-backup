To decide the best configuration in your circumstances, consider:

* Is it necessary to hide <i>all traffic</i> from the ISP? <ref name=all-traffic>
All traffic generated by the host and all applications running on the host. For example, Firefox, NTP, and anything else. This also includes traffic generated by {{project_name_long}}.
</ref> Then install the VPN on the host.
* Should the VPN provider be able to see <i>all traffic</i>? <ref name=all-traffic /> Then install the VPN on the host.
* Should the VPN provider be limited to seeing <i>Tor traffic</i>, but not <i>clearnet traffic</i>? Then install the VPN on {{project_name_gateway_long}}.
