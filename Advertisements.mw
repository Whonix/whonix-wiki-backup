About Advertisements on the {{project_name_long}} Website
}}
[[File:logo_box.png|thumb||{{project_name_long}} [[Dev/Logo|logo]]]]

Readers may have noticed that each documentation chapter has several advertisements in the footer. To remove all doubt, advertisements do <u>not</u>:

* result in monetary compensation for the {{project_name_long}} project;
* influence the direction of {{project_name_long}} development; or
* lead to changes in {{project_name_long}} software or website choices (apart from the advertisement itself).

The present list of advertisements includes:

* <u>Evolution Host</u>: provides system administration advice for the <code>{{project_clearnet}}</code> website.
* <u>Fosshost</u>: <code>fosshost.org</code> is a non-profit organization that provides hosting services to the open source community. <ref>Their website notes: <blockquote>The project operates free hosting services for the open source community. The infrastructure is donated by our hosting sponsors and is managed by a group of highly talented volunteers.</blockquote></ref> Many projects benefit from their services including GNOME, KDE, Debian, and FSFE. Fosshost provides a stage server for {{Kicksecure_link

}}. Update: https://twitter.com/fosshostorg/status/1596336045821661184

The past list of advertisements includes:

* <u>Jobble</u>: link exchange. It shows advertisements for {{project_name_long}} for related searches.
* <u>Search engines (YaCy | Qwant | ecosia | MetaGer | peekier)</u>: This is a voluntary listing by {{project_name_long}} and no discussions have occurred with any of these services. Also see [https://forums.whonix.org/t/local-browser-homepage-for-tor-browser-in-whonix/347/101 this forum post].

Any future changes will be documented on this page.

= Guidelines for Advertising on {{project clearnet}} =

* no targeted ads
* no tracking
* no spying
* no loading of web content from third party pages
* just text and images
* advertisements marked as advertisements
* no JavaScript

= Affiliate Policy =
This is only a consideration for a hypothetical future situation. Example: a VPN provider would offer sponsorship if {{project_name_long}} would provide a wizard for easily setting up VPN [trial] accounts.

* non-default option
* non-persuasive option
* installing only Freedom Software by default (no non-Free, proprietary, nagware)
* transparency about the partnership
* maybe publishing scale of sponsorship (sum)
* sticking to fair, nuanced, intellectually honest option about pros and cons
