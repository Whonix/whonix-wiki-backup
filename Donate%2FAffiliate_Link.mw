= Further Information =

== Short Overview ==
A referral link looks like a normal link but contains a unique identification code that tracks who refereed the user to the vendor. Referral links are very common on the internet. Often users are unaware that they are using referral links. Users usually perform web searches, find websites, blogs or forums that contain links to vendors or services that the user is interested in at the time. Often these links are referral links.

Instead of leaving it to random chance who receives a commission, if the user is intending to purchase from a vendor or to use a paid web-service anyhow, the user could consider to use an affiliate link provided by {{project_name_long}}. This might result in redirecting any commissions to {{project_name_long}} instead. This is a different type of donation. The user does not have to spend any extra money.

For example, rather than typing <code>fixedfloat</code> into Google, clicking these links and risking that Google or another advertiser earns a commission, the user could support their favorite project such as {{project_name_long}} by using the referral link provided by {{project_name_long}} and thereby redirecting the commission to {{project_name_long}}.

== Instructions ==
'''1.''' The user should do their own research if use of the third party vendor is secure.

'''2.''' The user clicks a link from this Donate by Affiliate wiki page.

'''3.''' The user makes a purchase directly from the affiliated third party.

'''4.''' Done.

The {{project_name_long}} project might receive a commission.

== Increasing Success Chances ==
Increasing chances that the {{project_name_long}} project will receive a commission.

== Notices ==

* <u>Not a guaranteed commission</u>: Note, it is not guaranteed that {{project_name_long}} will receive a commission. There are many reasons why {{project_name_long}} will not receive a commission. <ref>
* Technical issues by the affiliate.

== Affiliates Policy ==
Affiliate links have a risk of moral hazard for those who post referral links on the internet. Competing vendors have different prices and referral commissions. Some vendor might employ practices which are disadvantageous for the user (such as a worse product or service for the same price) to be able to pay higher referral commissions to referees (advertisers). Therefore in many forums and comment sections affiliate links are prohibited, deleted to reduce spam. In the worst case, referees only advertise the highest commission paying vendors which offer lower quality, bad prices or are even scams. To avoid moral hazard, the following affiliates policy is in place.

* Affiliate links are only shown on this wiki page.
* Limitations and disclaimers are transparently documented.
* No extra costs for the user.
* Non-endorsement.
