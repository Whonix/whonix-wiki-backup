}}
= Introduction =

Tor Browser is installed in {{project_name_long}} by default to browse the Internet anonymously. Tor Browser is optimized for safe browsing via pre-configured security and anonymity settings that are quite restrictive. It is recommended to read the entire [[Tor_Browser|Tor Browser]] chapter for tips on basic usage before undertaking any high-risk activities.

{{project_name_workstation_long}} contains all the necessary tools to post or run a blog anonymously. It is recommended to review the following chapters / sections, as well as follow all the recommendations on this page:

* [[Tips_on_Remaining_Anonymous|Tips on Remaining Anonymous]]
* [[Data_Collection_Techniques|Data Collection Techniques]]
* [[Tor_Browser#Unsafe_Tor_Browser_Habits|Unsafe Tor Browser Habits]]
* [[Hardware_Threat_Minimization|Hardware Threat Minimization]]

= Anonymous File Sharing =

== Audio Recordings ==

It is possible for adversaries to link audio recordings to the specific hardware (microphone) that is used. This has implications for shooting anonymous videos. It is also trivial to fingerprint the embedded audio acoustics associated with the particular speaker device; for example, consider ringtones and video playback in public spaces. <ref>[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~anupamd/paper/CCS2014.pdf Do You Hear What I Hear? Fingerprinting Smart Devices Through Embedded Acoustic Components]</ref> For these reasons it is recommended to follow the operational security measures in the [[#Photographs|Photographs]] section when sharing audio files.

This recommendation equally applies to any data that is recorded by each and every other sensor component, such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer accelerometers]. <ref>[https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1416 Mobile Device Identification via Sensor Fingerprinting].</ref> The best way to defend against this threat is to deny all access to the hardware in question, while also avoid the sharing of unencrypted data recorded by sensors. Similarly, it is inadvisable to share audio with third parties who have limited technical ability or if they are potentially malicious.

== Documents ==

Digital watermarks are a subset of the science of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography steganography] and can be applied to any type of digital media, including audio, pictures, video, texts or 3D models. <ref>For detailed information on this topic, see: [https://web.archive.org/web/20200725225105/https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mdr/teaching/modules03/security/students/SS5/Steganography.pdf Steganography and Digital Watermarking].</ref> In basic terms, covert markers are embedded into the "noise" of data which are imperceptible to humans: <ref>https://www.daoudisamir.com/steganography-and-watermarking/</ref>

<blockquote>Digital watermarking is defined as inserted bits into a digital image, audio or video file that identify the copyright information; the digital watermarking is intended to be totally invisible unlike the printed ones, bits are scattered in different areas of the digital file in such a way that they cannot be identified and reproduced, otherwise the whole goal of watermarking is compromised.</blockquote>

A digital watermark is said to be robust if it remains intact even if modifications are made to the files. <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_watermarking</ref> <ref>Notably the watermark does not change the size of the carrier signal.</ref> In addition to protecting copyright, another watermarking goal is to trace back information leaks to the specific source. A good countermeasure to this threat is to run documents through an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition optical character recognition (OCR)] reader and share the output instead.

According to a talk by Sarah Harrison from WikiLeaks, <ref>Missing footnote.</ref> source tracing can also happen through much simpler techniques such as inspecting the access lists for the materials that have been leaked. For example, if only three people have access to a set of documents then the hunt is narrowed down considerably.

Redacting identifying information in electronic documents by means of image transformation (blurring or pixelization) has proven inadequate for concealing the intended text; the words can be reconstructed by machine learning algorithms. Solid bars are sufficient but they must be large enough to fully cover the original text. Otherwise, clues are left about the length of underlying word(s) which makes it easier to infer the censored text based on the sentence remainder. <ref>[https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~saul/papers/pets16-redact.pdf On the (In)effectiveness of Mosaicing and Blurring as Tools for Document Redaction]</ref> Only digital redaction bars are recommended as manual  Sharpie ones can be insufficient, leading to leaks when documents are scanned.<ref>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/06/redacting-documents-with-a-black-sharpie-doesnt-work.html</ref>

== Photographs ==

Every camera's sensor has a unique noise signature because of subtle hardware differences. The sensor noise is detectable in the pixels of every image and video shot with the camera and could be fingerprinted. In the same way ballistics forensics can trace a bullet to the barrel it came from, the same can be accomplished with adversarial digital forensics for all images and videos. <ref>https://dde.binghamton.edu/download/camera_fingerprint/</ref> <ref>[https://github.com/guardianproject/ObscuraCam/issues/102 Fingerprintable Camera Anomalies]</ref> Note this effect is different from file [[Metadata]] that is easily sanitized with the [[Metadata#MAT2:_Metadata_Anonymisation_Toolkit_v2|Metadata Anonymization Toolkit v2 (MAT2)]]. <ref>While MAT2 does clean a wide range of files, the list of supported file formats is <u>not</u> exhaustive. Also, the author of MAT notes embedded media inside of complex formats might not be cleaned.</ref>

=== Photo-Response NonUniformity ===

A camera fingerprint arises for the following reason: <ref>https://www.slideshare.net/justestadipera/digital-image-forensics-camera-fingerprint-and-its-robustness</ref>

<blockquote>Photo-Response NonUniformity (PRNU) is an intrinsic property of all digital imaging sensors due to slight variations among individual pixels in their ability to convert photons to electrons. Consequently every sensor casts a weak noise-like pattern onto every image it takes and this pattern plays the role of a sensor fingerprint.</blockquote>

The reason for this phenomenon is all devices have manufacturing imperfections that lead to small variation in camera sensors, causing some pixels to project colors a little brighter or darker than normal. When extracted by filters, this leads to a unique pattern. <ref>https://www.futurity.org/smartphones-cameras-prnu-1634712-2/</ref> Simply put, the type of sensor being used, along with shot and pattern noise leads to a specific fingerprint.

The threat to privacy is obvious: if the camera reference pattern can be determined and the noise of an image is calculated, a correlation between the two can be formed. For example, [https://www.buffalo.edu/content/dam/www/news/photos/2017/12/ndss18-paper99.pdf recent research] suggests that only ''one'' image is necessary to uniquely identify a smartphone based on the particular PRNU of the built-in camera's image sensor. <ref>The error rates is less than 0.5%</ref> Major data mining corporations are starting to use this technique to associate identities of camera owners with everything or everyone else they shoot. <ref>https://www.google.com/patents/US20150124107</ref> It follows that governments have had the same capabilities for some time now and can apply them to their vast troves of data.

There are methods to [https://www.slideshare.net/justestadipera/digital-image-forensics-camera-fingerprint-and-its-robustness destroy, forge or remove PRNU], but these should only be used with caution. The reason is related research on the question of spoofing sensor fingerprints in image files has proven non-trivial and easily defeated. <ref>[https://ws2.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Research/EI7541-29.pdf Sensor Noise Camera Identification: Countering Counter-Forensics]</ref> <ref>Anonymizing the PRNU noise pattern of pictures remains a promising area of research.</ref>

=== Other Vectors ===

Other unique camera identifiers include specific JPEG compression implementation, distinct pattern of defective pixels (hot/dead), focal length and lens distortion, camera calibration and radial distortion correction, distribution of pixels in a RAW image and statistical tests such as Peak to Correlation Energy (PCE) ratio. <ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-019-08182-z</ref>

=== Operational Security Advice ===

This section assumes the user wants to preserve their anonymity, even when publicly sharing media on networks that are monitored by the most sophisticated adversaries on the Internet. Always conduct a realistic threat assessment before proceeding. These steps do not apply for communications that never leave anonymous encrypted channels between trusted and technically competent parties.

'''Table:''' ''Operational Security Advice''

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col"| '''Domain'''
! scope="col"| '''Recommendation'''
|-

! scope="row"| Current Devices
| It is almost a certainty that photos and videos have been shared from your current devices through non-anonymous channels. Do <u>not</u> use any of these devices to shoot media that will be shared anonymously.
|-

! scope="row"| Suitable Devices
|
Most will probably want to avoid phones altogether and use tablets instead, but for most situations phones are a reasonable choice:
* Buy a new Android phone with cash if possible.
* Avoid other choices because a proprietary operating system is a nonstarter.
* <u>In all cases</u> flash a freedom and privacy-respecting ROM before using the camera. Be aware that the glorified corporate malware that comes pre-installed on the phone will leak a range of data to the cloud.
|-

! scope="row"| Safe Use
|
* The camera must <u>only</u> be reserved for anonymous media.
* Do not commit serious mistakes like taking "selfies" or photographing places or people associated with you.
* Sanitize metadata with [[Metadata#MAT2:_Metadata_Anonymisation_Toolkit_v2|MAT2]] before sharing photographs anonymously online.
* Completely obscure faces with solid fills using an image manipulation program. Advancements in neural nets and deep machine learning make pixelated or gaussian blurred faces reconstructable. <ref>https://github.com/david-gpu/srez/blob/master/README.md</ref> <ref>[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.00408v2.pdf Defeating Image Obfuscation with Deep Learning]</ref>
* Consider using the [https://guardianproject.info/apps/obscuracam/ ObscuraCam] app from The Guardian Project to protect the identities of protestors: <ref>https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2016-September/004895.html</ref>
** It pixelates images using a technique resistant to facial reconstruction.
** ObscuraCam also offers a full pixel removal "black bar" option.

= Keystroke and Mouse Fingerprinting =
{{anchor|Keystroke Fingerprinting}}
Keystroke dynamics is a way to recognize people based on how they type. Everyone types in a unique way, just like handwriting or a signature. This poses a risk to anonymity and privacy because even if someone hides their IP address (like using Tor), their typing style can still expose their identity.

This is being elaborated on the [[Keystroke_and_Mouse_Deanonymization|Keystroke and Mouse Deanonymization]] wiki page.

In addition, users must also disguise their linguistic style to combat [[Surfing_Posting_Blogging#Stylometry|stylometric analysis]] and be aware of [[Surfing_Posting_Blogging#Mouse_Fingerprinting|mouse tracking techniques]] available to adversaries.

= Mouse Fingerprinting =

Mouse fingerprinting happens when software records how a user moves their mouse or cursor and where they click. This can help website designers, but it also creates de-anonymization risks. See [[Keystroke_and_Mouse_Deanonymization#Mouse_Fingerprinting|Mouse Fingerprinting]].

= Covert Impairments in Human Computer Interaction =

Recent [https://vmonaco.com/papers/Bug%20or%20Feature%20-%20Covert%20Impairments%20to%20Human%20Computer%20Interaction.pdf research] on deceptive input modifications - where a
site deliberately misrepresents mouse movements or key presses to elicit
a corrective user reaction - reveals that this reaction is apparently fingerprintable. This tactic is used in CAPTCHAs and site logins. Possible mitigations involve detecting third party meddling with inputs (since it is an active process) and applying anti-fingerprinting protections on the fly.

= Stylometry =

{{project_name_short}} does not obfuscate an individual's writing style. Consequently, unless precautions are taken (see below), users are at risk from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylometry stylometric analysis based on their linguistic style]. Research suggests only a few thousand words (or less) may be enough to positively identify an author and there are a host of software tools available to conduct this analysis.

This technique is used by advanced adversaries to attribute authorship to anonymous documents, online texts (web pages, blogs etc.), electronic messages (emails, tweets, posts etc.) and more. The field is dominated by A.I. techniques like neural networks and statistical pattern recognition, and is critical to privacy and security. Current anonymity and circumvention systems are focused on location-based privacy, but ignore leakage of identification via the content of data which has a high accuracy in authorship recognition (90%+ probability).
<ref name=stylometry>https://web.archive.org/web/20160304062339/https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~sa499/papers/adversarial_stylometry.pdf</ref>

There are multiple ways to conduct statistical analysis on "anonymous" texts, including: <ref name=stylometry /> <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylometry</ref>
<div style="column-count:2;-moz-column-count:2;-webkit-column-count:2">
* keystroke fingerprinting, for example in conjunction with Javascript
* stylistic flourishes
* abbreviations
* spelling preferences and misspellings
* language preferences
* word frequency
* number of unique words
* regional linguistic preferences in slang, idioms and so on
* sentence/phrasing patterns
* word co-location (pairs)
* use of formal/informal language
* function words
* vocabulary usage and lexical density
* character count with white space
* average sentence length
* average syllables per word
* synonym choice
* expressive elements like colors, layout, fonts, graphics, emoticons and so on
* analysis of grammatical structure and syntax
</div>

Fortunately, research suggests that by purposefully obfuscating linguistic style or imitating the style of other known authors, this is largely successful in defeating all stylometric analysis methods. This means they are no better than randomly guessing the correct author of a document. However, using automated methods like machine translation services does not appear to be a viable method of circumvention. <ref name=stylometry />

= Tips for Anonymous Posting, Blogging and Uploading =

Before undertaking any anonymous activities, be sure to understand and exercise a healthy dose of [[Tips_on_Remaining_Anonymous|Operational Security]] (OpSec). Even the best anonymity software available today cannot prevent catastrophic mistakes by individuals.

== Blogging ==

| Usually the blog is administrated via a web interface only. Use Tor Browser for all blog activities.
|-
! scope="row"| Blog Posting
| Every type of blog software offers the option to select a point in time when new postings are published. It is safer to delay the publishing of new posts to a time when you are not online anymore, rather than publishing immediately. <ref>This will trick lesser adversaries, who cannot force the blog service provider to reveal exactly when and for how long a blog administrator logged in. This will not fool the blog service provider nor an adversary capable of recording all internet traffic.</ref>
|-

High accuracy is achieved in limited situations, such as active authentication during log-on.</ref> <ref>This does not clear EU false positive requirements however, so they recommend it is combined with keystroke dynamics for extra confirmation, see: [https://web.archive.org/web/20230519163324/https://csis.pace.edu/~ctappert/it691-projects/mouse-pusara.pdf User re-authentication via mouse movements], [http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/faculty/pollett/papers/shivanipaper.pdf On Using Mouse Movements as a Biometric] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20190711092234/http://www.cs.wm.edu/~hnw/paper/ccs11.pdf http://www.cs.wm.edu/~hnw/paper/ccs11.pdf]</ref>
* When the methods above are combined with [[#Stylometry|Stylometry]], a user will be de-anonymized unless countermeasures are implemented, like faking one's authorship style <ref>For instance, stylometry works with less data (final text only) and in concert with keystroke fingerprinting is completely effective.

<blockquote>
While somewhat outside the scope of browser fingerprinting, for completeness it is important to mention that users themselves theoretically might be fingerprinted through their behavior while interacting with a website. This behavior includes e.g. keystrokes, mouse movements, click speed, and writing style. Basic vectors such as keystroke and mouse usage fingerprinting can be mitigated by altering Javascript's notion of time. More advanced issues like writing style fingerprinting are the domain of other tools.

See: [https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/129.pdf CDH Key-Extraction via Low-Bandwidth Electromagnetic Attacks on PCs]</ref> These attacks were mitigated by software countermeasures in cryptographic libraries such as GPG.
* There is a very crude proof-of-concept attack that remotely controls touchscreen devices via electromagnetic fields, with the caveat of it requiring close proximity to an antenna.

|In contrast to side-channel attacks, covert-channels depend on a compromised process operating on the machine to be able to exfiltrate data to the outside without being noticed by the machine operator. While attacks of this nature that cross security and virtualization boundaries on the same machine are known, this section covers air-gapped machines which are the hardest targets to penetrate from the attacker's perspective. While using SSD PCs are a solution to many of these attacks, they bring another set of problems regarding the impossibility of secure data erasure.

! scope="row"| Wi-Fi Signal Emitters
| Another keystroke snooping technique involves a WiFi signal emitter (router) and malicious receiver (laptop) that detects changes in the signal that correspond to movements of the target's hands on their keyboard. According to researchers, a user’s movement over the keyboard generates a unique pattern in the time-series of Channel State Information (CSI) values. A Wi-Fi signal based keystroke recognition system called WiKey can recognize typed keys based on CSI values at the Wi-Fi signal receiver end using Commercial Off-The-Shelf Wi-Fi devices. In real-world testing, “WiKey achieves an average keystroke recognition accuracy of 77.43% for typed sentences when 30 training samples per key were used. WiKey achieves an average keystroke recognition accuracy of 93.47% in continuously typed sentences with 80 training samples per key,”. Limitations, include variations in environment, as it can work well only under relatively stable environments. Human motion in surrounding areas, changes in orientation and distance of transceivers, typing speeds, and keyboard layout and size also influence the accuracy.<ref>[https://www.sigmobile.org/mobicom/2015/papers/p90-aliA.pdf Keystroke Recognition Using WiFi Signals]</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20221022104553/https://cse.msu.edu/~alikamr3/pdf/jsac2017_doublecolumn.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.securityweek.com/researchers-use-wifi-signals-read-keystrokes</ref><ref>In the paper: An attack variant using USRP (cellphone radio ranges) has performed poorly because of background energy interference due to microwave ovens, refrigerators, and televisions.</ref>

* External Devices: Avoid typing in places where open microphones are used, otherwise recorded keyboard sounds might provide enough information to accurately reconstruct what was typed. <ref>
This is a variation of an older attack perfected during the Cold War where recorded typewriter sounds allowed discovery of what was typed. See: https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2005/09/09/acoustic-snooping-typed-information/ and https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/10/eavesdropping_o_6.html

! scope="row"| File Sanitization
|
Generally, any blog pictures, documents or other files must have unique [[Metadata]] removed (anonymized) before they are uploaded - check the file format is compatible with the [[Metadata#MAT2:_Metadata_Anonymisation_Toolkit_v2|MAT2]] software: <ref>
Such as unique camera IDs and often GPS coordinates in the case of photographs.
</ref>
* Refer to the additional, [[#Operational_Security_Advice|operational security advice]] for photographs.
* Follow the same [[#Operational_Security_Advice|operational security advice]] for audio recordings.
* Refer to the additional [[#Documents|countermeasures]] for embedded digital watermarks in documents.

* Detection: Although a remote threat, thermal imaging can capture body heat remains from keys touched to input passwords up to one minute after the fact. <ref>
https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/07/recovering_keyb.html
</ref> Also avoid places with CCTV or those which risk shoulder surfing.
* Generation: Use random usernames and [[Passwords#Generating_Unbreakable_Passwords|strong Diceware passwords]] for anonymous accounts. <code>pwgen</code> should only be used to generate usernames and not passphrases because its emphasis is on generating phonemes; see footnote. <ref>
Such a bias means the program does what it is designed to do: produce pronounceable passwords rather than pure line noise. Even with the secure option <code>-s</code> it has been noted that it produces passwords with bias towards numbers and uppercase letters to make password checkers happy. The CVE to fix this was rejected and the behavior was not corrected by the authors. This is undesirable for creating true random output, see: [https://bugs.debian.org/726578 pwgen: Multiple vulnerabilities in passwords generation].
</ref>
* Retention: Consider the password-retention policy of the browser. If it supports a master password that encrypts every password it saves, then use that feature. It is generally safest not to save any blog or other passwords in the browser, but instead use a password manager and cut and paste passwords into the browser.
