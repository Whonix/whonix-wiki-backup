<u>{{non_q_project_name_short}}</u>:

* system-wide (requires [[root|administrative ("root") rights]]) (compatible with [[noexec]]): {{CodeSelect|code=
flatpak install flathub {{{package}}}
}}
* per-user (no administrative rights required) (probably not compatible with [[noexec]]): {{CodeSelect|code=
flatpak --user install flathub {{{package}}}
}}

What is better? System-wide or per-user?

* <>usability:</> [https://forums.whonix.org/t/flatpak-as-a-software-source-flathub-as-a-source-of-software/8500/61 Flathub is enabled by default system-wide but not per-user.]
* <u>multi-user:</u> On a multi-user system (probably if multiple human users use the same computer, which is rare nowadays), system-wide might be preferable as this saves disk space.
* <u>At preset:</u> Does not make any difference.
* <u>Future-proof:</u> Per-user might be more future-proof. It would be compatible with future {{project_name_short}} security improvements [[Dev/user-admin-split]] (strong user account isolation). However, [[noexec]] for the home folder is to be considered later, at which point this documentation needs to be updated once that has been implemented.

<u>{{q_project_name_short}} Template:</u> <code>flatpak</code> cannot be used with the <code>--user</code> option. This is because in case of using a Qubes Template, the flatpak needs to be installed system-wide into the <code>/var/lib/flatpak</code> folder. This is due to [[Qubes#Qubes_Persistence|Qubes Persistence]]. If the <code>--user</code> option was used, the flatpak would only be available in the Template's home folder but not in any App Qube based on that Template, because App Qubes have their own independent home folder.

<u>{{q_project_name_short}} App Qube:</u> <code>flatpak</code> should be used with the <code>--user</code> option. This is because in case of using an App Qube, the flatpak needs to be installed per-user only into the <code>~/.local/share/flatpak</code> folder and not system-wide. This is due to [[Qubes#Qubes_Persistence|Qubes Persistence]]. If the <code>--user</code> option was not used, the flatpak would only be available in the App Qube's non-persistent <code>/var/lib/flatpak</code> folder located in the root image.

'''3.''' Done.

The procedure of installing <code>{{{package}}}</code> is complete.

'''4.''' Upgrades notice.

<u>Note</u>: this procedure will not keep the software up-to-date. How to update installation installed by flatpak is also documented on the [[Operating System Software and Updates]] wiki page.
