This feature is either undocumented, untested, or unsupported. Options: Become a Contributor / Apply Self Support First Policy / Purchase Support.
}}
This wiki chapter refers to features that are presently either undocumented, untested or unsupported. Simply put, due to the wide-ranging nature of activities undertaken by the {{project_name_long}} community it is inevitable due to [[Reporting_Bugs#Policy_Rationale|constraints]] that certain features or requests will:

* have undocumented, incomplete or outdated instructions or use cases
* remain untested by either developers or the community
* have complex installation and configuration requirements for full or partial functionality
* not be implemented in the {{project_name_short}} source code

This does not necessarily imply "technically impossible".

The {{project_name_short}} project is highly receptive to the efforts of community members who take the time to identify shortcomings and share their ideas, literary or coding skills to improve the platform, particularly in the domains of software contributions, testing, forum offerings or documentation additions/improvements.

Community members can help ensure the continued success of {{project_name_short}} through four primary means:

# providing [[Reporting_Bugs#Community_Feedback|Community Feedback]]
# helping to implement features as a [[Contribute#Contributor|contributor]]
# purchasing support from an IT service provider so additional features can be implemented, documented, tested and/or further supported (at this time, the {{project_name_short}} project prefers to stay out of recommending any IT service providers)
# embracing the [[Self_Support_First_Policy|Self Support First Policy]] and becoming an active [[Free_Support_Principle#The_User_Co-developer_Concept|user co-developer]]

In summary, developers view the broader {{project_name_short}} community as an essential part of the strategy to realize a highly-secure platform with a host of valuable features. By assisting with undocumented, untested or unsupported features/feature requests, individuals can help fulfill shared goals and the ultimate progression of the {{project_name_short}} development roadmap. All contributions, big or small, can lead to promising new security or privacy protections. This is true even if progress is only incremental or due for later implementation.
