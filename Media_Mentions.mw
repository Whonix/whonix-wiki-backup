<blockquote>
Whonix is great because you can be confident that everything you do in the workstation VM is anonymously going through the Tor network. That means that hackers won’t be able to deanonymize you, unless they can escape from your VM." - [https://theintercept.com/2015/09/16/getting-hacked-doesnt-bad/ Micah Lee, Journalist and Security Engineer at The Intercept and Advocate for Freedom of the Press, Developer of OnionShare and Tor Browser Launcher.]

<blockquote>
If your task requires an anonymity that standard platforms cannot offer, Whonix may be the solution for you. - [https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/smb-technologist/whonix-adds-a-layer-of-anonymity-to-your-business-tasks/ TechRepublic]

<blockquote>
Tor alone does not necessarily insulate users from disclosing personally identifiable information... The project does come with an
extensive Security document that covers the technology behind Whonix, its advantages and disadvantages, threat model, best practices, and so on." - [https://lwn.net/Articles/520106/ lwn.net]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
One of Whonix core strengths is its flexibility. Whonix can run on Linux, MacOS, or Windows. It can torrify nearly any application's traffic running on nearly any operating system, and it doesn't depend on the application's cooperation. It can even isolate a server behind a Tor Hidden Service running on a separate OS." - [https://blog.torproject.org/tor-heart-whonix TorProject, Tor at the heart]

Tails and {{project_name_short}} users, and users of our sandboxed Tor Browser are unaffected, though.

Quote [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-announce/2013-August/000089.html The Tor Project co-founder Roger Dingledine]:

<blockquote>
And finally, be aware that many other vectors remain for vulnerabilities in Firefox. JavaScript is one big vector for attack, but many other big vectors exist, like css, svg, xml, the renderer, etc. We need help improving usability of (and doing more security analysis of) better sandboxing approaches [14] as well as VM-based approaches like Whonix [15] and WiNoN [16].
