It is inadvisable to run software that has reached end-of-life status. Developers do not fix existing defects, bugs or vulnerabilities in this case, leading to serious security risks.

For example, in 2018 [https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4203 VLC Media Player in Debian <code>jessie</code>] had reached end-of-life status in May of that year. In that case, {{project_name_short}} users who did not utilize a different media player were at risk, because VLC in Debian <code>jessie</code> has unpatched security vulnerabilities. This VLC vulnerability does not apply to the current stable {{project_name_short}} {{VersionShort}} release which is based on Debian <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code>.
