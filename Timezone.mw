<blockquote>
To protect against time zone leaks, the system clock inside {{project_name_short}} is set to UTC. This means it may be a few hours before or ahead of your host system clock. <u>Do not change this setting!</u>

'''1.''' Introduction.

'''{{project_name_short}} <u>specific</u> part:''' To prevent package [https://github.com/whonix/anon-apps-config anon-apps-config] from changing the timezone to UTC during upgrades, a status file must be created as documented in the next step. <ref>
https://github.com/Whonix/anon-apps-config/commit/85dcdaaeafe150a740949d5b8d167e6f0fa10c7d

'''4.''' Actual timezone change.

'''{{project_name_short}} <u>unspecific</u> part:''' Time zone can be adjusted as per [[Self_Support_First_Policy|Self Support First Policy]].

'''5.''' See upstream documentation.

'''6.''' Done.

The process of changing the timezone has been completed.

= Timezone vs sdwdate =
[[sdwdate]] is mostly unrelated. It can operate independently of system timezone setting. It is a time synchronization daemon. It does not alter the system timezone.

= Timezone vs Tor Browser =
[[Tor Browser]] has its own independent development team and independent implementation of timezone change. This is [[unspecific]] to Whonix. Tor Browser does the same on non-Whonix systems. In other words, Tor Browser does the same on Debian hosts. Changing the system timezone will not affect Tor Browser.
