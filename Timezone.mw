<blockquote>
To protect against time zone leaks, the system clock inside {{project_name_long}} is set to UTC. This means it may be a few hours before or ahead of your host system clock. <u>Do not change this setting!</u>

'''{{project_name_long}} <u>specific</u> part:''' To prevent package [https://github.com/whonix/anon-apps-config anon-apps-config] from changing the timezone to UTC during upgrades, create either file <code>/etc/noutc</code> or <code>/usr/local/etc/noutc</code>. <ref>

'''{{project_name_long}} <u>unspecific</u> part:''' Time zone can be adjusted as per [[Self_Support_First_Policy|Self Support First Policy]].

Note: system timezone as configured <code>/etc/timezone</code> / <code>/etc/localtime</code> is a "system setting". What (Xfce) graphical user interface clock widget is showing and its setting might be independent from the "system setting" since that is a "user setting".

= Timezone vs sdwdate =
[[sdwdate]] is mostly unrelated. It can operate independently of system timezone setting. It is a time synchronization daemon. It does not alter the system timezone.
