Ethereum Wallet Security Considerations and How to use ETH over Tor in {{project_name_short}}.

== MetaMask ==
Likely required: <code>allow this extension to run in private window</code>

== ETH vs Tor generally ==
Apparently the ETH developers are not prioritizing anonymity or Tor-anything even though it's supposedly uncensorable smart contracts.

Chaos issue tracker with nonsense lazy stale-bot that is closing issues which aren't fixed:

A full node directly over Tor is difficult due to node discovery because Tor does not support UDP. Quote: [https://medium.com/@oaeee/how-to-sync-an-ethereum-node-via-tor-755534775ae1 How To Sync an Ethereum Node via Tor]:

<blockquote>It’s important to do this right — in this step you select nodes you trust. If you get tricked into adding mostly compromised nodes, your Ethereum client can be manipulated into following a fake chain.</blockquote>

As a workaround [[Tunnel UDP over Tor]] might be used in theory but is [[Unsupported]] if that would be fast and reliable enough to download 1 TB (speak 1000 GB) and counting of blockchain data over Tor.

== Full Node Appliances ==
There are ETH full node ready-made box one can buy. Maybe easier for clearnet users. Difficult if anonymity is desired. Any anonymity features wouldn't have Whonix leak-proof robustness since for them it would be a gimmick and not project focus.
