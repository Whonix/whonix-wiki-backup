Documentation in the {{project_name_short}} wiki provides guidance on adding third-party software from various upstream repositories. This is especially useful since upstream often includes generic instructions for different Linux distributions, which may be complex for users to follow. Additionally, documentation in {{project_name_short}} usually places a higher emphasis on security and verifying digital software signatures.

The instructions provided here serve as a "translation layer" from upstream documentation to {{project_name_short}}, offering assistance in most scenarios. Nevertheless, it's important to recognize that upstream repositories and software may change over time. Consequently, the documentation on this wiki might require occasional updates, such as revised signing key fingerprints, to remain current and accurate.

Please note, this is a general wiki template and may not apply to all upstream documentation scenarios.

Users encountering issues, such as signing key problems, are advised to follow the [[Self_Support_First_Policy|Self Support First Policy]] and engage in [[Reporting_Bugs#Generic_Bug_Reproduction|Generic Bug Reproduction]]. This involves attempting to replicate the issue on Debian <code>{{stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}}</code>, and contacting upstream directly if the issue can be reproduced, as such problems are likely [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]]. In most cases, {{project_name_short}} is not responsible for, nor capable of resolving, issues stemming from third-party software.

For further information, refer to [[Introduction#User_Expectations_-_What_Documentation_Is_and_What_It_Is_Not|Introduction, User Expectations - What Documentation Is and What It Is Not]].

Should the user encounter bugs related to third-party software, it is advisable to report these issues to the respective upstream projects. Additionally, users are encouraged to share links to upstream bug reports in the {{project_name_short}} forums and/or make edits to this wiki page. For example, if there are outdated links or key fingerprints that need updating, please feel free to make the necessary changes. Contributions aimed at maintaining the accuracy and currency of information are highly valued. These updates not only improve the quality of the wiki but also serve as a useful resource for other users.
