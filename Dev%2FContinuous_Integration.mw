= General Note about CI Services in use for Building {{project_name_long}} =
Since all [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration Continuous Integration] (CI) services we know of run Ubuntu and {{project_name_long}} is based on Debian.

Even if a {{project_name_long}} Ubuntu based build would exist and CI build pass, that would not necessarily mean, that a Debian based build would have passed as well. Therefore the usefulness of the results would be limited anyhow. Nevertheless, compatibility with CI environments is a very useful "stress test" for the build script. It helps early spotting most bugs, which break the build.

Since there are no free CI services supporting {{Code2|mount}} ({{Code2|device-mapper}}), there is unfortunately no CI service which could be used for building {{project_name_long}} Virtual Machine images.

See also [[Dev/Build_Documentation/10_full#Warning|warning not to use images created inside Continuous Integration (CI) environments for anything besides testing]]!
