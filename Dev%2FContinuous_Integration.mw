== General Note about Free CI Services in use for Building {{project_name_short}} ==
Since all [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration Continuous Integration] (CI) services we know of run Ubuntu, and {{project_name_short}} is based on Debian.

Even if an Ubuntu based build of {{project_name_short}} existed and CI builds passed, that would not necessarily mean that a Debian based build would have passed as well. Therefore, the usefulness of the results would be limited anyway. Nevertheless, compatibility with CI environments is a very useful "stress test" for the build script. It helps spot most bugs early that break the build.

Since there are no free CI services supporting {{Code2|mount}} ({{Code2|device-mapper}}), there is unfortunately no free CI service that could be used to build {{project_name_short}} Virtual Machine images.

[[Dev/Build_Documentation/images#Host_Preparation_Notices|Warning not to use images created inside Continuous Integration (CI) environments for anything other than testing]]!
