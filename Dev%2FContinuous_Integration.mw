= Other CI Services not in use due to issues =
== codeship.io ==
* No root. - Asked support. - Impossible to build {{project_name_short}} VM images. kpartx and mount require root.

== General Note about Free CI Services in use for Building {{project_name_short}} ==
Since all [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration Continuous Integration] (CI) services we know of run Ubuntu and {{project_name_short}} is based on Debian.

Even if a {{project_name_short}} Ubuntu based build would exist and CI build pass, that would not necessarily mean, that a Debian based build would have passed as well. Therefore the usefulness of the results would be limited anyhow. Nevertheless, compatibility with CI environments is a very useful "stress test" for the build script. It helps early spotting most bugs, which break the build.

Since there are no free CI services supporting {{Code2|mount}} ({{Code2|device-mapper}}), there is unfortunately no free CI service which could be used for building {{project_name_short}} Virtual Machine images.

[[Dev/Build_Documentation/VM#Host_Preparation_Notices|warning not to use images created inside Continuous Integration (CI) environments for anything besides testing]]!
