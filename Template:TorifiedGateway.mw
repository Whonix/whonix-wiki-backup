All traffic originating from [[Whonix-Workstation|{{project_name_workstation_long}}]] and [[Whonix-Gateway|{{project_name_gateway_long}}]] is routed over [[Tor]]. <ref>
Since {{project_name_long}} version <code>0.2.1</code> {{project_name_gateway_long}} traffic is also routed over Tor. In this way, use of {{project_name_long}} is hidden from persons or systems observing the network.
</ref> <ref>
To preserve the anonymity of a user's {{project_name_workstation_long}} activities, it is not necessary to torify {{project_name_gateway_long}} own traffic.

For reader interest: If DNS settings on {{project_name_gateway_long}} are changed in <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>, this only affects {{project_name_gateway_long}} own DNS requests issued by applications using the system's default DNS resolver. By default, no applications issuing network traffic on {{project_name_gateway_long}} use the system's default DNS resolver. All applications installed by default on {{project_name_gateway_long}} that issue network traffic (apt, [https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Systemcheck systemcheck], [[sdwdate]]) are explicitly configured, or forced by uwt wrappers, to use their own Tor <code>SocksPort</code> (see [[Stream Isolation]]).
</ref> <ref>
{{project_name_workstation_long}} default applications are configured to use separate Tor <code>SocksPorts</code> (see [[Stream Isolation]]), thereby not using the system's default DNS resolver. Any applications in {{project_name_workstation_long}} that are not configured for stream isolation - for example <code>nslookup</code> - will use the default DNS server configured in {{project_name_workstation_long}} (via <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code>), which is the {{project_name_gateway_long}}. Those DNS requests are redirected to Tor's DnsPort by {{project_name_gateway_long}} firewall. {{project_name_gateway_long}} <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> does not affect {{project_name_workstation_long}} DNS requests.
</ref> <ref>
Traffic generated by the Tor process itself which runs by Debian default under user <code>debian-tor</code> originating from {{project_name_gateway_long}} can use the internet normally. This is because user <code>debian-tor</code> is exempted in [[{{project_name_gateway_short}}_Firewall|{{project_name_gateway_long}} Firewall]], allowed to use the "normal" internet.

The Tor software (as of <code>0.4.5.6</code>) (and no changed were announced at time of writing) almost exclusively uses TCP traffic. See also [[Tor#UDP|Tor wiki page, chapter UDP]]. For DNS, see next footnote.
</ref> <ref>
Tor does not require, use functional (system) DNS for most functionality. IP addresses of Tor directory authorities are hardcoded in the Tor software as per Tor upstream default. Exceptions include:

* proxy settings using proxies with host names rather than IP addresses
* the Tor pluggable transport meek lite to resolve domains used in setting <code>url=</code>, <code>front=</code> to IP addresses.
