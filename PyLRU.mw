PyLRU python library

__FORCETOC__
= Introduction =

PyLRU is: <ref>https://pypi.org/project/pylru/</ref>
<blockquote>...a true LRU cache along with several support classes. The cache is efficient and written in pure Python. It works with Python 2.6+ including the 3.x series. Basic operations (lookup, insert, delete) all run in a constant amount of time. Pylru provides a cache class with a simple dict interface. It also provides classes to wrap any object that has a dict interface with a cache. Both write-through and write-back semantics are supported. Pylru also provides classes to wrap functions in a similar way, including a function decorator.</blockquote>
