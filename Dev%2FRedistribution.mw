== Introduction ==
Developers only!

These are notes for producing official [[Download|downloadable]] binary {{project_name_short}} images.

== Pre Building ==
=== Major Upgrade ===
* <u>'''https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/todo#trixie_port'''</u>

Check if updates needed:

'''1.''' https://github.com/Kicksecure/kicksecure-base-files/blob/master/etc/kicksecure_version

'''2.''' https://github.com/Kicksecure/dist-base-files/blob/master/usr/share/distro-info/kicksecure.csv

'''3.''' https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/whonix-base-files/blob/master/etc/whonix_version

'''4.''' live-config-dist/etc/calamares/branding/Whonix-Host/branding.desc

=== Point Release ===
'''1.''' package <code>timesanitycheck</code>: <code>./usr/share/timesanitycheck/date-minimum-file-create</code>

'''2.''' update VirtualBox download link if a newer is available

https://github.com/derivative-maker/derivative-maker/blob/master/windows/virtualbox/download.txt

'''3.''' update VirtualBox SHA256SUMS file if a newer is available

https://github.com/derivative-maker/derivative-maker/blob/master/windows/virtualbox/SHA256SUMS

=== Unsorted ===
{{Box|text=
Clean source code

* <ref>
get rid of .directory files inside the source code:

<code>thunar</code> &rarr; <code>preferences</code> &rarr; <code>general</code> &rarr; <code>behavior</code> &rarr; <code>use common view properties for all folders</code>

</ref>
* <ref>
Get rid of <code>~backup</code> files. In other words, get rid of files starting with <code>~</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
find ./ -name '*~' {{!}} xargs trash-put
}}
</ref>
* You can get a list of unwanted files with <code>git clean -dfxn</code> and remove them with <code>git clean -dfx</code>.

* Update {{project_name_short}} debian package repository.

* add your own <code>default-key</code> to your own <code>/home/user/.gnupg/gpg.conf</code>.

* Check that all packages point to a signed git commit and signed git tag.

{{CodeSelect|code=
dm-packaging-helper-script pkg_verify_signed_commit_and_tag
}}

* push the source code to github

{{CodeSelect|code=
git push origin master
}}

* Check, that the current git commit is a signed. <ref>
You might wish using a <code>git</code> or <code>bash</code> alias to safe typing.
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
git log --show-signature HEAD^..HEAD
}}

Or use the generic makefile as a shortcut.

{{CodeSelect|code=
make git-commit-verify
}}

* Create an OpenPGP signed git tag. This will also be used as {{project_name_short}} version number.

{{CodeSelect|code=
git tag -s version
}}

* Make sure the current git head is a signed git commit and signed git tag.

To simplify this, you could use the generic makefile.

{{CodeSelect|code=
make git-verify
}}

* Push the OpenPGP signed git tag to github.

{{CodeSelect|code=
git push origin version
}}
}}

== Building ==
=== Notes ===
'''1.''' <u>Remote Repository:</u> By convention, enable {{project_name_short}} stable repository by default. (<code>--repo true</code>) This is already the case below due to <code>export dist_build_redistributable=true</code> used below.

'''2.''' For other options and platforms also see [[Dev/Build_Documentation|build documentation]].

=== Build ===
'''1.'''

{{CodeSelect|code=
export dist_build_redistributable=true
}}

'''2.''' Build {{project_name_gateway_long}}. For example {{project_name_gateway_long}} with LXQt for VirtualBox.

{{CodeSelect|code=
./derivative-maker --target virtualbox --flavor whonix-gateway-lxqt
}}

'''3.''' Build {{project_name_workstation_long}}. For example {{project_name_workstation_long}} with LXQt for VirtualBox.

{{CodeSelect|code=
./derivative-maker --target virtualbox --flavor whonix-workstation-lxqt
}}

== Post Building ==
Upload the images.

{{CodeSelect|code=
dm-upload-images
}}

=== Testing ===
* {{CodeSelect|code=
/usr/share/whonix-ws-firewall/unit_tests/stream_isolation_test
}}
* At least a few testers should test final releases before posting a news. Testers may be found by posting a news.
* [[Dev/Leak_Tests|Leak Tests]]!
* [[Test]] the images before final release! (Testers-only releases can be uploaded straight away.)

=== Update Permanent Links ===
{{Box|text=
Update permalinks.

<pre>
sudoedit /etc/nginx/conf.d/download_redirects
</pre>

}}

=== Git Tag ===
Create <code>-testers-only</code> or <code>-stable</code> git tag.

=== Announcement Text Creation ===
