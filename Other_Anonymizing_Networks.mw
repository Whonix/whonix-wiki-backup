{{project_name_long}} can be <u>paired</u> with any other suitable anonymizing network. This means the other network will be tunneled through [[Tor]].

''In theory'', Tor could be completely <u>replaced</u> with another suitable anonymizing network; see [[Dev/Technical Introduction#{{project_name_short}} Framework|{{project_name_short}} Framework]]. Development in this area has stalled due to a lack of interest from users, upstream developers, and {{project_name_short}} developers. Interested readers can refer to the [[Dev/Inspiration|Inspiration]] entry, which outlines some research along with theoretical and practical work completed to date.

In general, the [[Dev/Technical Introduction#{{project_name_short}} Framework|{{project_name_short}} Framework]] is agnostic regarding which anonymizing network is used. The primary reason {{project_name_short}} started with Tor is because all developers were Tor users. It only occurred to developers much later that alternatives could be used.

Unlike the Tor network, at present {{project_name_short}} support for other anonymizing networks is fairly rudimentary. Although {{project_name_short}} developers have great respect for Tor alternatives, along with their developers and users, they are simply more accustomed to the Tor network (which is also a personal preference). It is also very difficult to simultaneously stay up-to-date, maintain equal interest, and be fully educated about a wide range of other anonymizing networks.
