== Safety Advice ==

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = '''Warning''': Be careful what you say, especially in public places that are archived!
}}
What is said may reveal personal information such as:

* Location / IP Address.
* Personality.
* Skills, Aims, Goals.
* Personal Details.
* ...

To keep the IP address hidden, visit these websites anonymously over Tor, using either the {{project_name_workstation_long}} or [https://www.torproject.org/download/ Tor Browser] from The Tor Project. To delink questions from an existing email or OpenID, it is advisable to create a separate email address, OpenID, and user name/s just for this purpose.

Be careful with the advice received from public places. Always get a second opinion and do not run commands or perform steps which you do not understand. Never post any custom code or output that pertains to your system or onion service specifically.

=== Brief Recommendations ===

It is recommended to follow these steps in order:

# [[Please_Use_Search_Engines_And_See_Documentation_First|Please use Search Engines and see Documentation First]].
# Check the [[Documentation]] to see if the question has already been discussed. Use the {{project_name_long}} internal search engine and external search engines (DuckDuckGo, Startpage).
# Search the [https://forums.{{project_clearnet}} {{project_name_long}} User Forums] and [[Reporting_Bugs#Issue_Tracker|issue tracker]] for the problem.
# If possible, search for a solution without the {{project_name_long}}-specific part of the question, as it may have been answered in mainstream Linux fora. ([[unspecific]])
# Check if the problem can be replicated in vanilla operating system environments like [https://www.debian.org/ Debian] <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code>, XFCE, inside the virtualizer, or over [https://www.torproject.org Tor].
# See [[#General Advice|General Advice]].
# See [[Introduction|documentation introduction, user expectations, footnotes and references]].
# After completing steps 1-6, a specific support request should be made if the user cannot locate a similar reference for their problem. Suitable options may include Debian user forums, unix stackexchange, VirtualBox forums, KVM mailing lists, Qubes' issue tracker, Tor mailing lists, software-specific community / developer forums (for example, LibreOffice), and so on.
# See also [[Reporting_Bugs#Support_Request_Policy|Support Request Policy]].
# In case {{project_name_long}} specific issues or feature requests see also [[Reporting_Bugs|Bug Reports and Software Development]].
# Consider [[Reporting_Bugs#Generic_Bug_Reproduction|Generic Bug Reproduction]].
# If no solution is found, the user should create a new post in the [https://forums.{{project_clearnet}} {{project_name_long}} User Forums].
# If a solution is provided, please consider editing the [[Documentation|{{project_name_long}} Documentation]] as a small contribution and/or providing a complete answer in the {{project_name_long}} User Forums.

=== Free Support Principle Rationale ===

In an ideal world, all free support requests would be answered with minimal to no effort or systems would run flawlessly, thus negating the need for asking questions. Unfortunately, real world systems are flawed and developer time and knowledge is limited. This is further elaborated in [[Reporting_Bugs#Policy_Rationale|{{project_name_long}} Support Policy Rationale]].

{{project_name_long}} will always be free in price as well as in freedom ([[Reasons for Freedom Software|Why?]]). In order to create a solid open source software solution, {{project_name_long}} has adopted the approach of {{Code2|treating users as co-developers}}. <ref>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar#Lessons_for_creating_good_open_source_software
</ref> This concept is further elaborated below.

==== The User Co-developer Concept ====

The majority of common questions have been answered in the available [[Documentation]]. If the solution to an issue is already documented, users will usually receive just a link to the documentation in response to their question.

{{project_name_long}} is a Linux distribution, with {{project_name_long}} developers and users playing the role of integrators. {{project_name_long}} itself is based on several components and software distributions developed by other projects; it is standing on the shoulders of giants.

In simple terms, {{project_name_long}} is based on: <ref>This is explained in more detail on the [[About]] page.</ref>

* A [[Supported_Platforms|supported platform]] ([https://www.debian.org/ Debian]).
* Two software packages produced by [https://www.torproject.org The Tor Project (TPO)] - [https://www.torproject.org Tor] and [[Tor Browser]].
* A host of other software packages.

It is impossible for the [[Contributors|{{project_name_long}} contributors]] to be aware of the solution to each and every problem that is encountered. Users are therefore encouraged to first consider if their problem is general, and unspecific to {{project_name_long}}.

Putting this principle into action means rephrasing the question, seeking solutions in other arenas, and preferably documenting this solution in the [[Documentation]]. Experience has shown that for some questions, this is the only realistic way to solve them.

Users might [[Linux User Experience versus Commercial Operating Systems|expect {{project_name_long}} to provide a unified experience]] similar to a Windows machine. While the {{project_name_long}} developers make every effort to meet user expectations, limited funding and human resources makes meeting these expectations impossible. <ref>
A problem all Linux distributions face.
</ref>

==== {{project_name_long}} Reliance on Debian ====

{{Based_on_Debian}}

An example of an inappropriate question seeking {{project_name_long}} support would be "How do I save a document in Libre Office as a PDF?". The solution is easily found by use of Internet search engines. Even if a solution was difficult to find, LibreOffice would behave identically on Debian and other operating systems. Logically, the recipient for the question should be the LibreOffice community.

On the other hand, in the unlikely event this hypothetical problem only occurred in {{project_name_long}}, then it would constitute an appropriate support referral, for example: "I know how to save a document in LibreOffice as a PDF. It doesn't work in {{project_name_long}}. How can I make it work in {{project_name_long}}?"
