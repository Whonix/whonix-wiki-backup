== Safety Advice ==

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = '''Warning''': Be careful what you say, especially in public places that are archived!
}}
What is said may reveal personal information such as:

* Location / IP Address.
* Personality.
* Skills, Aims, Goals.
* Personal Details.
* ...

To keep the IP address hidden, visit these websites anonymously over Tor, using either the {{project_name_workstation_long}} or [https://www.torproject.org/download/ Tor Browser] from The Tor Project. To delink questions from an existing email or OpenID, it is advisable to create a separate email address, OpenID, and user name/s just for this purpose.

Be careful with the advice received from public places. Always get a second opinion and do not run commands or perform steps which you do not understand. Never post any custom code or output that pertains to your system or onion service specifically.

== General Advice ==
{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = '''Tip:''' Avoid using new or unconventional terminology where possible to prevent confusion. For instance, refer to "Debian testing repository" as is, rather than renaming it to "Debian test repository".
}}

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = '''Tip:''' Be careful not to confuse {{Code2|Tor}} with {{Code2|Tor Browser}} in discussions, as this can lead to misunderstandings. Remember, the correct term is Tor, not TOR.
}}
