= {{project_name_workstation_short}} Overview =

[[Whonix-Workstation|{{project_name_workstation_short}}]] is a software component of {{project_name_long}}, which is designed to provide users with a secure and anonymous environment for running applications and performing online tasks. Once installed, {{project_name_workstation_short}} is connected to [[Whonix-Gateway|{{project_name_gateway_short}}]], which runs Tor processes and acts as a gateway, while {{project_name_workstation_short}} runs user applications on a completely isolated network.

All user applications, such as [[Tor Browser]], should be launched from {{project_name_workstation_short}} to ensure they utilize the Tor network, as only Tor connections are permitted. {{project_name_workstation_short}} also provides stream isolation for many pre-installed or custom-installed applications, such as Hexchat and Thunderbird, using a dedicated Tor SocksPort to prevent identity correlation that may otherwise occur.

{{project_name_workstation_short}} is already pre-configured for use with {{project_name_gateway_short}}. For a functional network connection, {{project_name_gateway_short}} must be started before {{project_name_workstation_short}}. However, if the startup sequence is reversed, {{project_name_workstation_short}} can only be used offline without a running {{project_name_gateway_short}}, as it will either use the Tor network or have no network connectivity at all.

{{project_name_short}} is based on security-focused Linux Distribution {{Kicksecure_link
|
|{{Kicksecure}}
}}. To learn more about {{project_name_short}}, please see the [[About|Overview]] and [[Features]] pages. <ref>
