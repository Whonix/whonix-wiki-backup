= {{project_name_workstation_long}} Overview =

[[Whonix-Workstation|{{project_name_workstation_long}}]] is software. After installation of {{project_name_long}}, {{project_name_workstation_long}} will be connected to [[Whonix-Gateway|{{project_name_gateway_short}}]]. The latter runs Tor processes and acts as a gateway, while the former runs user applications on a completely isolated network.

{{project_name_workstation_long}} is the place where all user applications like [[Tor Browser]] should be launched. This also ensures applications will utilize the Tor network because only Tor connections are permitted.

{{project_name_long}} also provides stream isolation for many pre-installed or custom-installed applications when they are used simultaneously in {{project_name_workstation_long}}. For example, Tor Browser, Hexchat, Thunderbird and several other applications use a dedicated Tor SocksPort, preventing identity (pseudonym) correlation that may otherwise occur when the same Tor circuit and exit relay are used.

{{project_name_workstation_long}} is already pre-configured for use with {{project_name_gateway_short}}.

For a functional network connection, {{project_name_workstation_long}} requires a running {{project_name_gateway_short}}. It is therefore recommended to first start {{project_name_gateway_short}} before {{project_name_workstation_long}}.

But it is also okay if the startup sequence is reversed. If {{project_name_gateway_short}} is off, {{project_name_workstation_long}} can only be used offline. Even without a running {{project_name_gateway_short}} there is no way {{project_name_workstation_long}} could connect to the clearnet internet. In other words, {{project_name_long}} is fail-safe. <ref>
[[Dev/Technical_Introduction|Technical Introduction]].
</ref> {{project_name_workstation_long}} will either use Tor network or have no network connectivity at all.
