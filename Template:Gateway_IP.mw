* IP address:
** [[{{non_q_project_name_short}}|{{non_q_project_name}}]]: <code>10.152.152.10</code>
** [[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]]
*** If Qubes Tools in the custom workstation are:
**** <u>Installed:</u> Find out the IP address of [[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]] {{project_name_gateway_long}} by running <code>qubesdb-read /qubes-gateway</code> inside the custom workstation.
**** <u>Not installed:</u> Find out the IP address of [[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]] {{project_name_gateway_long}} by running <code>qubesdb-read /qubes-ip</code> inside {{project_name_gateway_vm}}.
*** Unfortunately the IP address will not be static. This means after restarting <code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code> the connection might break and the IP address setting may need to be manually updated.
**** Development: Qubes feature request [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1477 Optional static IP addresses] was implemented but {{q_project_name}} feature request [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T947 Qubes-Whonix eth1 static networking] is not implemented yet at time of writing.
