= Additional Survey Questions =
We invite all community members to contribute by suggesting questions they would like to be included in the survey. Your input is crucial in creating a survey that encapsulates the diverse perspectives and experiences within the Whonix community. Whether you have suggestions for improving existing questions or want to propose entirely new questions, your contributions are highly encouraged. 

Please edit this wiki page to add or modify questions for the survey. No wiki account is required for edits. Just press the edit button. Edits are held for moderation as a spam prevention measure.

= Eligibility =
Supporters of Whonix, gauged by their estimated contributions, are eligible to participate in the survey.

= Voting Weight =
The voting weight of participants is internally assessed and kept confidential. It's challenging to equitably compare donations against contributions. While financial donations are straightforward to measure, evaluating contributions is inherently complex.

= Implementation Criteria =
* Financial Cost
* Technical Feasibility
* Maintainability
* Legal Implications

= Participation Simplicity =
* '''Simplicity:''' The objective is to maintain minimal bureaucracy, ensuring every response is valuable and counted.

= Response Expectations =
* '''Expectations management:''' Please keep your expectations low.
* '''Return receipt only:''' Due to the high volume of feedback expected, please do not expect a reply apart from a return receipt. It will be impossible to engage with everyone individually.
* '''Feature requests and bug reports:''' If replies are desired, going through the usual [[Support]] will be better.
* '''Clarification questions:''' In rare cases, clarification questions might be asked which the user is free to ignore.

= Submission Guidelines =
Draft:

* '''Web form:''' Submit a web form. Or,
* '''E-mail:''' To submit the questionnaire, please [[Contact#For_Private_Inquiries|email]] Developer Patrick Schleizer.
* '''Forums:''' Alternatively, public posts in the {{project_name_long}} forums are also acceptable.
* '''Anonymous submissions:''' Are acceptable however will have a lower weight than verified contributors.

= Survey Software - Web Form =
TODO: No survey software candidates have been researched, found yet.

requirements:

* self-hosted,
* privacy-preserving,
* reliable,
* Open Source.

It might be the case that there will be no web form but only a text file to fill out and submit by e-mail or forums.

= Verification of Support =
* '''Voting weight:''' Participants who verify their support (via donations or contributions) will receive a substantially higher voting weight.
* '''Verification:''' Verification can be conducted privately and securely. Use a unique "password" in the designated box below for this purpose.

== Proof of Contribution ==
Minimally bureaucratic.

* '''Past and current contributors:''' All contributors mentioned on the [[Contributors|contributors]] wiki page only need to be properly authenticated through the usual means and assert their inclusion.
* '''Code contributions:''' Share a link to your GitHub (or equivalent) profile. A lightweight protection against impersonating needs to be provided.
* '''Forums:''' Share a link to your Whonix forum or issue tracker profile.
* '''Others:''' Other methods to [[Contribute]] are also acknowledged.

== Proof of Donation ==

* '''PayPal:''' For payments made via bank wire or PayPal: Providing your real name or email address will suffice.
* '''Crypto:''' For payments made using cryptocurrency: Supply a signed message from the address used to send funds. This is supported by most cryptocurrency wallets and is unnecessary for already recognized users.
** '''Bitcoin:''' Message signing from the address which sent a donation is also possible with the Bitcoin Electrum wallet.
** '''Ethereum :''' Similar to above. Message signing.
** '''Monero:''' Revealing the precise (or approximate) time of payment and amount could serve as verification since this data is concealed from third parties, making impersonation nearly impossible.
* '''Others:''' Please ask if that applies to you.

= Privacy =
Participants have the option to choose between the following privacy settings for their survey submission:

* '''Anonymized Submission''': Your responses will be completely anonymized. Your name and email will be disassociated from the data, and only the voting weight assigned to your submission will be considered.
* '''Identified Submission''': Your name and/or email will be associated with your responses, which may be beneficial for follow-up discussions or clarifications.

Please note that regardless of your choice, all submissions will be handled with the utmost care to ensure privacy and confidentiality.
