In oversimplified terms, {{project_name_short}} is just a collection of configuration files and scripts. {{project_name_short}} is not a stripped down version of Debian; anything possible in "vanilla" Debian GNU/Linux can be replicated in {{project_name_short}}. Likewise, most problems and questions can be solved in the same way. For example: "How do I install VLC Media Player on {{project_name_short}}?" -- "The same way as in Debian <code>apt install vlc</code>. {{project_name_short}} does not break anything, limit functionality, or prevent installation of compatible software.
