= Warnings =
A reasonably accurate host clock is crucially important. An inaccurate clock can lead to:

* '''A)''' Broken internet connectivity, and
* '''B)''' [[Time Attacks]].

Therefore, at all times it is recommended to have a host clock with accuracy of up to ± 30 minutes. Clocks that are days, weeks, months or even years slow or fast can lead to many issues such as connectivity problems with Tor, inability to download operating system upgrades and inaccessible websites. <ref>
Due to invalid (not yet or no longer valid) TLS certificates.
</ref>

Follow the platform-specific recommendations below to avoid Tor connectivity problems and to limit possible adverse anonymity impacts.

= Host Clock =

Your computer's host clock must have an accuracy of at least ±30 minutes, ideally better. Otherwise, connectivity can be broken. A minutes range of accuracy is more than enough for {{project_name_short}}. No need for seconds or let alone nanoseconds accuracy resolution.

* '''Prerequisite knowledge:''' time formats, 12 hours AM/PM, 24 hours format, timezones. (Common knowledge. Not specific to computers.)
* '''Generic task:''' Check your computer's time and make sure it is reasonably correct.
* '''Operating system specific.'''

'''1.''' Host timezone.

The host timezone can stay as is. There is no need at all to change the host timezone for the sake of a functional {{project_name_short}} connectivity.

'''2''' Notice.

This is [[Unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]]. This wiki chapter is only about making sure the host clock is reasonably correct. There is no need to specifically follow these steps, unless difficulties are being experienced.

In case of issues, contact the support of your host operating system.

'''3.''' Find out the time in UTC.

Any website or device can be used.

'''4.''' Show the current system time in UTC using GNU <code>date</code>.

This is useful:

* To find out the current system time of your computer in UTC timezone format.
* To learn the text output format of GNU <code>date</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
date --utc
}}

Sample output:

<pre>
Fri 05 May 2023 08:10:30 AM UTC
</pre>

'''5.''' Fix the clock, if necessary.

Choose either option '''A)''' <u>or</u> '''B)'''.

<u>NOTE:</u> For the following command, use the current time. Adjust the time to the actual time. Do not use the example time used below.

* '''A)''' Using any method supported by your host operating system.
* '''B)''' Using command line with GNU <code>date</code>: {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo date --utc --set "Fri 05 May 2023 11:30:50 AM UTC"
}}

'''6.''' Update the hardware clock.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo hwclock --utc --systohc
}}

(<code>--systohc</code> stands for system to hardware clock.)

'''7.''' Show the current system time in UTC using GNU <code>date</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
date --utc
}}

'''8.''' Compare the system clock with the hardware clock.

Time formats might be different, but the time should be the same or very similar.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo date --utc && sudo hwclock --utc
}}

'''9.''' Reboot.

Optional.

Reboot and recheck if the clock is correct. Usually should be. Only in rare cases of broken hardware clocks, the time might be wrong.

'''9.''' Done.

The process of correcting the host clock has been completed.

= Clock Accuracy =
A number of things influences clock accuracy inside {{project_name_short}} VMs.

}}
* [[sdwdate]]: {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=Sdwdate#sdwdate_Clock_Randomization

* Generally, sdwdate accuracy is limited because it fetches time over Tor from onions.
* [[Timezone]]: While not influencing clock accuracy, this can lead to confusion.

* <u>{{project_name_gateway_short}}</u>: It is strongly discouraged to pause / suspend / save / hibernate the {{project_name_gateway_short}}, because it is difficult to restore the clock after resume. <ref name=gateway_pause>
This is because the clock will be incorrect after system resume. A correct clock is important for anonymity (see [[Dev/TimeSync]] to learn more).

When a user suspends or saves the VM state, the clock will stop and continue after resuming, leading to a time that lags behind the correct value. This can cause later Tor connectivity problems or introduce possible adverse anonymity impacts.

The {{project_name_gateway_short}} state should not be suspended or saved. It is far better to  power it off when it is no longer needed.

If this advice is ignored, Tor can become confused if the time is more than 1 hour in the past or more than 3 hours in the future. When this happens, Tor will only reconnect to the Tor network if the clock is manually fixed or powered off and on again.

= Block Networking until sdwdate Finishes =
== Rationale ==
[[Sdwdate|sdwdate]] is a Tor-friendly replacement for rdate and ntpdate that sets the system's clock by communicating via end-to-end encrypted TCP with Tor onion webservers. Since timekeeping is crucial for security and anonymity, blocking network access until sdwdate succeeds is sensible. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/testers-wanted-blocking-networking-until-sdwdate-finished-status-of-sdwdate-gui/5372</ref>

[[sdwdate]] is functional on both {{project_name_gateway_short}} and {{project_name_workstation_short}}, but in some cases it is possible for the time to leak before it is changed. Potential leak channels include time or other servers, daemons, and client programs such as Tor Browser which are used before sdwdate successfully changes the system clock for the first time after boot. <ref>
https://phabricator.whonix.org/T533
</ref> In this case, the user is only left with the protections afforded by [[Boot Clock Randomization]]. <ref>
[[Dev/TimeSync#Block_Networking_until_sdwdate_Finishes]]
</ref>

== Enable ==
{{Testers-Only}}

<u>Note:</u> The following instructions should be applied on {{project_name_gateway_short}} and inside {{project_name_workstation_short}}.

([[Qubes|{{q_project_name_short}}]]: It is the easiest to apply changes in the {{project_name_gateway_short}} and {{project_name_workstation_short}} Templates since these settings will be inherited by all App Qubes. Alternatively, apply this setting in App Qubes, see footnote. <ref>

= NTP =
== Disabling NTP ==
If ISP tampering with NTP is ever confirmed, users are advised to [[Time_Attacks#GNU.2FLinux_Host|disable NTP]] and manually update the host clock out-of-band. For example, a watch or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_clock atomic clock] can be used for this purpose. If the tampering is targeted and not a widescale attack, then the user already has much bigger problems to worry about than NTP; see [[Warning#Confirmation_Attacks|Confirmation Attacks]].

If following the advice above -- disabling NTP on the host and adjusting the clock out-of-band -- be aware that clearnet traffic might be easier to fingerprint. <ref>See the [[Fingerprint]] page to discover what fingerprinting means in this case.</ref> The reason is that it introduces a device issuing clearnet traffic (such as OS updates), but without the use of NTP. It is unknown how many people have NTP which is deactivated, broken, uninstalled, or never in fact installed in the first place. Also unknown is how many people are using alternative time synchronization methods such as authenticated NTP, tails_htp, tlsdate, [[sdwdate]] or similar. However, search engine research suggests that very few people fall into both these categories.

== NTP Issues ==
The host system clock synchronization mechanism still uses unauthenticated NTP from a single source. This is not optimal, but there is no real solution to this problem. <ref>See Design: [[Dev/TimeSync]].</ref> A potential attack vector is created by this NTP behavior; the ISP and/or time server could either inadvertently or maliciously introduce a significant clock skew, or the host clock could simply malfunction.

If the host clock value is grossly inaccurate -- more than one hour in the past or more than 3 hours in future -- Tor cannot connect to the Tor network. <ref>In this case, Tor cannot verify the Tor consensus.</ref> This is easily solved by manually fixing the clock on the host, then powering the {{project_name_gateway_short}} (<code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code>) off and on again.

Another side effect of a significantly inaccurate host clock concerns operating system (OS) updates and cryptographic verification on the host. Until the host clock is manually fixed, it may no longer be possible to download updates or verify SSL certificates correctly with the host browser.

Users should always check whether a host clock defect relates to an empty battery before assuming the ISP is tampering with NTP.

Unfortunately, it is not yet possible to set a random clock offset for {{q_project_name_short}} VMs to prevent clock correlation attacks since it is [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T440 unsupported by Xen].
