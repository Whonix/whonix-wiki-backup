'''{{project_name_short}} is a free and open-source desktop {{os}}''' that is specifically designed for [https://www.whonix.org/#security advanced security and privacy]. It's based on the [https://torproject.org Tor] anonymity network, security-focused Linux Distribution {{Kicksecure_link
|
|{{Kicksecure}}
}}, GNU/Linux and the principle of security by isolation.

'''{{project_name_short}} [[Whonix_against_Real_Attacks|defeats common attacks]] while maintaining usability'''. Online anonymity and censorship circumvention is attainable via fail-safe, automatic and desktop-wide use of the Tor network. This helps to protect from traffic analysis by bouncing communications around a distributed network of relays run by global volunteers. Without advanced, end-to-end, netflow correlation attacks, an adversary watching an Internet connection cannot easily determine the sites visited, and those sites cannot discover the [[Users_of_Whonix|user]]'s physical location. <ref>
Current practical, low-latency, anonymity designs like Tor fail when the attacker can see both ends of the communication channel (traffic going into and out of the Tor network). [https://blog.torproject.org/one-cell-enough-break-tors-anonymity/ If you can see both flows], simple statistics based on data volume and timing can determine whether they match up.
</ref>

'''{{project_name_short}} uses an extensively security reconfigured of the Debian base ({{Kicksecure}} Hardened)'''. It consists of two virtual machines -- [[{{project_name_gateway_short}}|{{project_name_gateway_short}}]] and [[{{project_name_workstation_short}}|{{project_name_workstation_short}}]] -- which are designed to be used on a [[Download|supported]] host OS ([[Host_Operating_System_Selection|Host Operating System Selection]]). The host OS supporting {{project_name_short}} is usually the one installed on the user's computer, but OSes installed on external drives will also work ([[USB Installation]]). Users choose the preferred {{project_name_short}} configuration and may use either a Type I hypervisor ([[Qubes|{{q_project_name_long}}]]), or a Type II hypervisor like [[KVM|KVM]] and [[VirtualBox|VirtualBox]].

'''This architecture provides a substantial layer of protection from malware and [[Data_Collection_Techniques#IP_Address|IP]] leaks'''. Applications are pre-installed and configured with safe defaults to make them ready for use with minimal user input. The user may install custom applications or personalize their desktop without fear of information leaks that could lead to de-anonymization. {{project_name_short}} is the only actively developed OS designed to be run inside a VM and paired with Tor. Though technically a "desktop" operating system, the security and anonymity tools {{project_name_short}} provides also make it ideally suited for hosting secure and anonymous onion services.

'''By helping [[Users_of_Whonix|users]] run applications anonymously {{project_name_short}} aims to preserve privacy and anonymity'''. A [[Tor Browser|web browser]], [[Software#Office_Suite|office suite]], and [[Software|other relevant applications]] come pre-configured with security in mind. Internet traffic by {{project_name_short}} is all routed through the Tor anonymity network.

{{project_name_short}} is [[Reasons for Freedom Software|Freedom Software]] and is based on {{Kicksecure_link

'''Privacy is a human right'''. The increasing threat of mass surveillance and repression all over the world means our freedoms and privacy are rapidly being eroded. {{project_name_short}} is a powerful solution to this problem. Anyone who values privacy, has business secrets, needs private communication or does sensitive work on their desktop or online can greatly benefit from using {{project_name_short}}. This includes the following. Also see [[Users_of_Whonix|Users of {{project_name_short}}]].

# '''Investigators and whistleblowers whose work threatens the powerful'''. Within our isolated environment, research and evidence can be gathered without accidental exposure.
# '''Researchers, government officials or business-people who may be targets of espionage'''. Anti-malware and anti-exploit modifications lower the threat of trojans and backdoors.
# '''Journalists who endanger themselves and their families by reporting on organized crime'''. Compartmentalized, anonymous Internet use prevents identity correlation between social media and other logins.
# '''Political activists under targeted surveillance and attack'''. The usefulness of threatening the ISP in order to analyze a target's Internet use is severely limited. The cost of targeting a {{project_name_short}} user is greatly increased.
# '''Average computer users in a repressive or censored environment'''. Easy Tor setup and options for advanced configurations means users in repressive countries can fully access the Internet desktop-wide, not just in their browser.
# '''Average computer users who simply don’t want all or some aspect of their private lives uploaded, saved and analyzed'''. {{project_name_short}} does not silently upload identifying information in the background.

</ref> The former runs Tor processes and acts as a gateway, while the latter runs user applications on a completely isolated network. The {{project_name_short}} architecture affords several benefits:

* Only connections through Tor are permitted.
* Servers can be run, and applications used, anonymously over the Internet.
* DNS leaks are impossible.
* Malware with root privileges cannot discover the user's real IP address.
* Threats posed by misbehaving applications and user error are minimized.
* The platform has [https://www.whonix.org/#security extensive security hardening].

== Full Spectrum Anti-Tracking Protection ==

'''Hiding your identity is harder than just hiding your IP'''. Internet tracking companies don't even need to know your IP address to be able to identify you. They have multiple alternative tracking technologies in their arsenal. Whonix provides full spectrum anti-tracking protection.

== Security by Isolation ==

'''{{project_name_short}} is the best way to use Tor and provides the strongest protection for your privacy online by hiding your real IP address, because {{project_name_short}} protects from leaks'''. In laymen's terms a leak occurs if a user expects to be wholly using Tor, but instead some application traffic bypasses Tor and is routed over the normal internet (clearnet). A solitary leak is all that is required to de-anonymize the user, for example via IP leaks, DNS leaks, UDP and other channels.

'''Even when Tor provides sufficient anonymity, it can be [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TorifyHOWTO very complicated or impossible] for users to configure applications''' so all traffic is routed through the Tor network. The reason is networking is very complex and most applications are not designed with anonymity or privacy in mind. Some applications like the Tor Browser Bundle are specifically designed for anonymity and attempt to eliminate all known leak vectors.  Unfortunately, despite all best efforts leaks have occurred in the past due to [[Whonix_against_Real_Attacks#Tor_Browser_Bundle|Tor Browser Bundle software defects (bugs)]]. In such cases, {{project_name_short}} users were protected and unaffected by these leaks.

'''In {{project_name_short}}, DNS and other related leaks (IP, DNS, UDP, ICMP) are impossible'''. Even malware with root privileges cannot discover the user's real IP address because {{project_name_short}}'s split-VM design ensures all internet traffic is routed through Tor.

''{{project_name_short}} is divided into two VMs'':

* [[{{project_name_gateway_short}}|{{project_name_gateway_short}}]] to enforce routing of all Internet traffic through the Tor network, and
* [[{{project_name_workstation_short}}|{{project_name_workstation_short}}]] for work activities. {{project_name_workstation_short}} is unaware of its real external IP address, which means the user's real external IP address is always protected and leaks are impossible.

'''This security by isolation configuration averts many threats posed by [[malware]], misbehaving applications, and user error.'''

'''This is not an empty claim -- {{project_name_short}} has been audited via the [[corridor]] (Tor traffic whitelisting gateway) and other [[Dev/Leak Tests|leak tests]]'''. In over a [[History|decade]], no leaks were ever discovered.

== Online Anonymity via Tor ==

[[File:Tor-logo.png|thumb|130px|alt=Tor logo]]
{{project_name_short}} relies on the Tor network to protect a user's anonymity online; all connections are forced through Tor or otherwise blocked. Tor helps to protect users by bouncing communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world. Without advanced, end-to-end, netflow correlation attacks, anybody watching a user's Internet connection cannot easily determine the sites visited, and those sites cannot learn the user's physical location. <ref>
Current practical, low-latency, anonymity designs like Tor fail when the attacker can see both ends of the communication channel (traffic going into and out of the Tor network). {{Archive_link

{{Anchor|Release and Support Schedule}}

= Release Schedule =

Note that {{project_name_short}} does not have a fixed release schedule. A new stable release only becomes available when it is deemed ready. Interested users can query the [[Reporting_Bugs#Issue_Tracker|issue tracker]] <ref>
For example, for the next release use the tag "{{project_name_short}} 16" and status "Open".
</ref> and [[changelog]] to track developer progress. [[Stay Tuned]].

= Support Schedule =
== Debian Hosts ==
'''New Debian Release'''

<u>One month</u> after a new stable version of <u>Debian</u> is released, {{project_name_short}} VMs may no longer be supported on any older version of Debian. All users need to upgrade the Debian platform promptly after the deprecation notice in order to use {{project_name_short}} safely.

'''New {{project_name_short}} Release'''

<u>One month</u> after a new stable version of <u>Whonix</u> is released, older versions will no longer be supported. All users need to upgrade the {{project_name_short}} platform promptly in order to remain safe.

'''Deprecation Notices'''

The deprecation notice is provided at least one month in advance and posted in the [https://forums.{{project_clearnet}}/c/news {{project_name_short}} News forum]. [[Stay Tuned]]! All users need to upgrade the respective platform promptly in order to remain safe. <ref>This also relieves {{project_name_short}} developers from needing to diagnose and support old-stable versions of Qubes/Debian/{{project_name_short}}, which duplicates the maintenance burden.</ref>

== Debian-based and Other Hosts ==
As per [[#Debian Hosts|Debian Hosts]].

== Windows Hosts ==
The support schedule is mostly undefined at present, but likely to mirror [[#Debian Hosts|Debian Hosts]].

== Qubes Hosts ==
'''{{q_project_name_short}} version support policy'''

{{project_name_short}} templates are supported by the {{project_name_short}} Project. The {{project_name_short}} Project has set its own support policy for {{project_name_short}} templates in Qubes.

This policy requires {{project_name_short}} template users to stay reasonably close to the cutting edge by upgrading to new stable releases of Qubes OS and {{project_name_short}} templates within a month of their respective releases. To be precise:

* One month after a new stable version of Qubes OS is released, {{project_name_short}} will no longer be supported on any older Qubes OS release. This means that users who wish to continue using {{project_name_short}} on Qubes OS must always upgrade to the latest stable Qubes OS release within one month of its release.
* One month after a new stable version of {{project_name_short}} is released for a given Qubes OS release, older {{project_name_short}} releases will no longer be supported on that Qubes OS release. This means that users who wish to continue using {{project_name_short}} on Qubes OS must always upgrade to the latest stable {{project_name_short}} version that is available for their Qubes OS release within one month of that {{project_name_short}} version’s release.

We aim to announce both types of events one month in advance in order to remind users to upgrade. [[Stay Tuned]].

'''{{q_project_name_short}} version support information'''

* <u>Old stable support:</u> Qubes 4.1 Whonix 16 will continue to receive security support until Qubes R4.2 is released as stable + 1 month. Support will likely be extended. <ref>
See also [https://forums.whonix.org/t/current-status-qubes-4-1-whonix-16/17191 Current Status Qubes 4.1 Whonix 16].
