Tor Browser, which is developed by upstream, The Tor Project (TPO), an independent entity has hard configured to use Tor as a proxy.

* Upstream does not support user using Tor Browser with an additional extra proxy at the end of the chain, i.e.: <code>user</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>proxy</code> &rarr; <code>destination</code>
* Upstream does also not support using Tor Browser with a proxy other than Tor, i.e.: <code>user</code> &rarr; <code>custom proxy</code> &rarr; <code>destination</code>. This may or may not currently be possible but upstream does not provide documentation on how to do this.
* Upstream does also not support using Tor Browser with a VPN instead of Tor, i.e. <code>user</code> &rarr; <code>VPN</code> &rarr; <code>destination</code>.
* Upstream does also not support using Tor Browser with a VPN in addition before Tor, i.e. <code>user</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>VPN</code> &rarr; <code>destination</code>.

That makes sense from TPO's perspective as a project that maintains a browser that should always connect using the Tor network. Due to that perspective, proxy settings have been removed from Tor Browser to avoid user confusion and accidental misconfiguration. Little attention is spend on custom proxy settings. That, from TPO's perspective is assumed to only make sense for users using a Tor transparent proxy and that are already running Tor on a different computer in their LAN. Only a minority of users is using such configurations.

Because of this organisational and technical background, the highly specialized use case of configuring Tor Browser running inside {{project name workstation long}} to use an additional proxy (<code>user</code> -> <code>Tor</code> -> <code>proxy</code> -> <code>destination</code>) is difficult to accomplish.
