None of the following warnings affect the build. Refer to relevant footnotes for further information.

Debian bug report: [https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1075960 cowbuilder: stop passing obsolete --mirror and --distribution parameters to pbuilder to silence superfluous pbuilder warning "W: --override-config is not set; not updating apt.conf Read the manpage for details."]

<pre>
Can not write log, openpty() failed (/dev/pts not mounted?)
</pre>
<ref>This is nothing to be concerned about; it only happens because commands are run inside chroot. Research of this "issue" indicates it is purely cosmetic.</ref>

-----

<pre>
[....] Your system does not have the CPU extensions required to use KVM. Not doing anything. ...[ FAIL ]
</pre>
<ref>
KVM is installed as a dependency of the build dependency <code>libguestfs-tools</code>. KVM is not needed to build the actual images.
</ref>

<pre>
[....] Stopping VirtualBox kernel modules [ ok ].
[....] Starting VirtualBox kernel modules[....] No suitable module for running kernel found ...[ FAIL ]
invoke-rc.d: initscript virtualbox, action "restart" failed.
</pre>
<ref>
This only means that VirtualBox cannot be started. VirtualBox kernel modules could not be compiled because the {{Code|linux-headers-$(uname -r)}} package was not installed prior to installing VirtualBox (before starting derivative-maker). The build script does not start VirtualBox, hence does not affect the build. The build script only uses <code>VBoxManage</code> for creation of virtual machine description files and that tool does not need VirtualBox kernel modules.

<pre>
WARNING: The character device /dev/vboxdrv does not exist.
	 Please install the virtualbox-ose-dkms package and the appropriate
	 headers, most likely linux-headers-486.

	 You will not be able to start VMs until this problem is fixed.
</pre>
<ref>
This is caused by the same issue referenced above.

<pre>
dpkg: warning: failed to open configuration file '/root/.dpkg.cfg' for reading: Permission denied
</pre>

<ref>
This happens because <code>debuild</code> is run as user, not root. It is probably a bug in dpkg. Research of this issue reveals there are many similar bugs in dpkg.
</ref>

-----

<pre>
sudo: unable to resolve host host
</pre>

<ref>
The hostname is changed intentionally to <code>host</code> inside the VM image. The cause is probably package <code>anon-base-files</code> postinst running <code>hostname "$my_host_name"</code> / <code>hostname host</code>. This change should only happen inside the change root <code>chroot</code>. This issue might be resolved by porting from <code>chroot</code> to <code>systemd-nspawn</code>, but it is not very important.
