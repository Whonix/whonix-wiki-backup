{{project_name_gateway_long}} and {{project_name_workstation_long}}

* Better comment on the top for .d style configuration folders/files as contributed by @JasonJAyalaP
* [[Desktop#RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter|RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter]]: now easier to use other display managers. It simply starts whatever the default display manager is.
* whonixcheck version check ({{project_name_short}} News), now supports - checking {{project_name_short}} Build Version and {{project_name_short}} Deb Version separately - having multiple up to date versions (for example for stable, testers and developers) - having separate news per build or deb version
* whonixcheck: Deactivated checking status of bootclockrandomization, timesanitycheck and timesync. Its already tested every time, timesync runs. Leaving it enabled in whonixcheck could make some users believe, that whonixcheck runs timesync, which it does not.
* whonixcheck, timesync: To get rid of the confusing line "/usr/lib/whonix/systemcheck/help_output: line 348:  9404 Killed [...]" at the end, added disown "$ZENITY_PROGRESS_PID".
* whonixcheck: prefixed all messages with the name of each test.
* whonixcheck: New WHONIXCHECK_DISABLE_TRANS_PORT_TEST configuration variable. When set to 1, skips whonixchecks test for Tor's TransPort. Useful in case you deactivated Tor's TransPort.; Separate help messages for {{project_name_gateway_short}} and {{project_name_workstation_short}} in case network connection (whonixcheck's SocksPort test) failed.; Better help messages for {{project_name_gateway_short}} and {{project_name_workstation_short}} in case network connection (whonixcheck's SocksPort test) failed.; New additional help text in case Tor is not detected "You could try to find out if this IP is/was a Tor exit relay using a search engine or ExoneraTor: https://metrics.torproject.org/exonerator.html". Lets see if we keep that in the final.; Different help messages if Tor detection on Tor's SocksPort failed vs Tor detection on Tor's TransPort failed.
* improved many messages in whonixcheck, timesync, whonixsetup
* no longer hardcoding MAC addresses, no longer sharing MAC addresses among all {{project_name_short}} versions, was very little gain, while it can confuse complex setups
* whonixcheck: - added option to skip SocksPort test for [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/57 #57] - no longer delete temporary folder, gets automatically deleted only makes debugging/auditing harder
* converting {{project_name_short}} News Blogs to plain text, so no external links to wordpress.com get loaded
* added pandoc (required for whonixcheck as html2text converter)
* whonix_shared/etc/apt/sources.list.whonix: changed from Debian stable (wheezy) to Debian testing (jessi) for [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/60 #60] (installation of python-stem)
* whonixcheck: now also checks Tor's bootstrap status using Tor's control port using [[Dev/onion-grater|onion-grater (Control Port Filter Proxy)]]
* added hint to read [[Computer Security Education]] to VirtualBox license files ([https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/64 #64])
* quick and dirty hack to make AppArmor play well with tor, obfsproxy and flashproxy for [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/67 #67]
* added log viewer ksystemlog to whonix-shared-desktop-kde
* moved whonixcheck zenity progress bar and result message to the top left, so it does not overlap with sdwdate's progress bar or result message
* replaced tails_htp with sdwdate
* AppArmor: added global /etc/hosts.whonix r, /etc/resolv.conf.whonix r, On {{project_name_workstation_short}} this file does not contain anything interesting (except some special configuration) and {{project_name_gateway_short}} is not supposed to have applications reading those files. Closes [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/66 #66]
* added apparmor-notify to whonix-shared-packages-recommended: Notification with passive popups when AppArmor restricts something. There are no profiles activated by default (except Tor, which gets loaded by its default init script), but still useful to prevent confusion just in case.
* No longer abort whonixcheck if Tor's SocksPort is not reachable ([https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/49 #49]). Now directly checking Tor's bootstrap status through Tor's control port ([https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/57 #57]).
* whonix_shared/usr/bin/uwt: Ignoring -t server_type and therefore defaulting to 4. 5 does not work well with the torsocks version from Debian testing. (Things like dget and update-command-not-found are broken.) Reporting a bug against torsocks is not worth it, since torsocks is currently being rewritten anyway.

{{project_name_gateway_short}}

* whonixsetup: Working around another bug in Tor. When starting Tor fails, it does not return a non-zero return code.
* added apper to whonix-gateway-packages-recommend
* Added RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter info message to {{project_name_gateway_short}} wallpaper.
* {{project_name_gateway_short}} firewall: added settings for an optional Tor relay
* whonix_gateway/usr/bin/whonix_firewall: Fix. When GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMING_FLASHPROXY is set to 1, iptables does not support -p all --dport. See https://serverfault.com/questions/279361/iptables-p-all-dport. Changed to -p tcp, which is sufficient, according to https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/FlashProxyHowto

{{project_name_workstation_short}}

* added pinentry-qt4 to whonix-workstation-default-applications, required to make KGpg symmetric encryption (and gnupg-agent) work out of the box
* No longer add Tor Browser default icon to the Desktop (already existing icons won't be touched, so this will appear in the next build version), the Tor Browser Recommend icon is still on the desktop and the default one can still be created from the start menu, closes [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/58 #58]
* {{project_name_short}} torbrowser update check and download script: has now a working progress bar.
* {{project_name_short}} torbrowser update check and download script: fixed zenity cancel button, cancel now effectively terminates still running curl instances and can therefore prevent endless data attacks or bugs.

Source Code

* new bash pseudo GUI toolkit /usr/lib/whonix/doutput
* whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_create_swap_file: fixed support for re-running
* radically shortened readme
* added libfile-fcntllock-perl to build dependencies: - required to silence dpkg-gencontrol:   warning: File::FcntlLock not available; using floc
* renamed whonix_workstation/etc/systemcheck.d/30_torbrowser to whonix_workstation/etc/systemcheck.d/30_torbrowser_default
* new maintainer script: release/resign_repository, Refreshes repository. OpenPGP Resignes and updates valid-until field.
* Got rid of time consuming "chown --recursive user:user /home/user/" while updating by running the required commands as user in the first place
* debian/rules-helper.bsh: added --no-start to dh_installinit. Restarting the init scripts while updating is not required. All init scripts are su
* postinst.d scripts: better error message in case a postinst.d script ever fails
* postinst.d scripts: hide "set -x" debug output, unless WHONIX_DEB_DEBUG=1
* added whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/pre.bsh, a script supposed to be sourced by all postinst.d scripts
* uwtwrapper: renamed variable ip to uwtwrapper_gateway_ip to avoid conflicts
* Fix: Skipping to source config.d files such as .dpkg-old and .dpkg-dist.
* {{project_name_short}} News v2: changed location to https://sourceforge.net/projects/whonixdevelopermetafiles/
* whonix_shared/usr/bin/whonix_repository: moved repository to https://sourceforge.net/projects/whonixdevelopermetafiles/
* whonix_shared/usr/lib/whonix/systemcheck/50_check-whonix-news: added --fail to curl, so it returns non-zero when sourceforge replies 404 (in case the file has been forgotten to upload). Otherwise we would end up with the error html page and throw a OpenPGP verification failure message.
* added debug-steps/locally-upgrade-whonix-debian-packages, a script to manually update from source code, closed [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/52 #52]
* apply our apt preferences.d settings (apt pinning) while building {{project_name_short}} from source code and while updating {{project_name_short}} from source code
* Added python-stem to whonix-shared-packages-dependencies.
* explicitly define /etc/apt/sources.list for grml-debootstrap to ensure grml-debootstrap won't fetch non-freedom software
* `displace`ed /etc/apparmor.d/local/system_tor
* added dh-apparmor to build dependencies
* Revised the way how the temporary local apt repository is created and removed.
* Fixed a bug when an own signing key was used to sign the local apt repository. No longer copying the whole pubring.gpg to /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/, only copying the specific signing key.
* Fixed a failure bug when dist_build_apt_codename was not set to local (now also works for stable, testers and developers).
* Reduced code duplication.

= 101adretemp (uploaded to {{project_name_short}} developers apt repository) =

{{project_name_gateway_short}} and {{project_name_workstation_short}}

* whonixcheck, timesync: cleaner locking mechanism, no longer using pgrep, thus fixing a confusing message while booting
* whonixsetup: starting whonixcheck after enabling Tor ([https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/56 #56])


{{project_name_gateway_short}}

* improved whonixsetup output
* added icons for {{project_name_gateway_short}} desktop

{{project_name_workstation_short}}

* whonix_workstation/usr/bin/torbrowser: updated links to important and feature blog
* Deactivating kmix autostart. Workaround to fix Klipper (and others?) autostart. Working around [https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=630617 bug]
* torbrowser: added --clearnet option. Uses torproject.org clearnet domain instead of torprojects Tor onion service (hs). Useful in case the hs
* Tor Browser Update and Start script: Will no longer show a browser error when whonixcheck (rawdog) hasn't fetched {{project_name_short}} News blog already. Wil
* {{project_name_short}} torbrowser Start and Update script now reads /etc/systemcheck.d/30_torbrowser_default which can contain the language setting
* torbrowser: updated forum link to [[Special:AWCforum]]


Source Code

* whonix_gateway/usr/lib/whonix/cpf-tcpserver: better escaping (now produces no more strange output when telneting it or accessing it with tor-ct
* FIX: added QUIT to control port filter proxy white list, otherwise after 40 connections tcpserver wouldn't accept any more connections
* whonix_gateway/usr/lib/whonix/cpf-tcpserver: exit and therefore terminate connection when getting QUIT
* {{project_name_gateway_short}}: added uuid-runtime, contains uuidgen, required for Control Port Filter Proxy
* new release/maketorrent, maintainer script for creation of torrent downloads for {{project_name_short}} * updated links from sourceforge.net to whonix.org
* build-steps.d/2600_export-vbox-vm: add version number to final .ova file
* new chroot post script: Storing from which {{project_name_short}} version a build was created in /usr/share/whonix/build_version.
* /etc/fstab: Fix. Removed "UUID=26ada0c0-1165-4098-884d-aafd2220c2c6 /               ext4    noatime,errors=remount-ro 0       1" since we are no longer modifying the uuid of the virtual hdd
* deleted whonix_shared/etc/fstab.whonix, this is now handled by whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_create_swap_file, which is better
* added reprepro to build dependencies, since required for creating (local) APT repository
* build-steps.d/1100_prepare-build-machine: allow running without --torgateway or --torworkstation

= 97adretemp (uploaded as testers-only VM build version, uploaded to {{project_name_short}} stable apt repository) =

{{project_name_gateway_short}} and {{project_name_workstation_short}}

* only disable powersaving if a virtual machine can be detected
* new whonixdesktop_autostart_decision_feature variable, for easy deactivation of that feature
* VirtualBox import license text: added license text with some help, disclaimer and license
* removed hardware modifications, very little gain, while it breaks enabling uefi and confuses other things as well
* added aptitude stream isolation wrapper
* whonixcheck, timesync --showcli: added "End of "$SCRIPTNAME". Feel free to press <enter> to return back to your normal prompt."
* moved blog to wordpress.com, better than sourceforge, because wordpress.com supports SSL, closed [https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/23 #23]

{{project_name_workstation_short}}

* deactivate the kgpg tray icon by default ([https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/10 #10]), not perfect, but less confusing, since it will now hopefully start in foreground

Source Code

* timesanitycheck: fixed, since version file does not exist anymore, using newly created build_timestamp by whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_build_timestamp
* whonix_gateway/usr/lib/whonix/whonixsetup/ft_m_1: working around a bug in Tor
* fixed modification of {{project_name_short}} modified /home/user/.bashrc
* updated shortcuts
* whonix_shared/usr/bin/backgroundd: revised
* added gsfonts, required for backgroundd (desktop background image manipulation)
* whonix_gateway/usr/bin/controlportfilt: add "-l host" to disable local hostname lookup to prevent timeouts (since there is on purpose no functional /etc/resolv.conf on {{project_name_gateway_short}})
* whonix_gateway/usr/bin/controlportfilt: more debugging
* fixed firewall rules for control port filter proxy; comments; refactoring
* gateway controlportfilt: added -H to tcpserver, so it doesn't hang if /etc/resolv.conf is not configured, which is the case on {{project_name_gateway_short}}
* gateway controlportfilt: added debugging to tcpserver
* gateway controlportfilt: fix, let tcpserver listen on all interfaces, not just 127.0.0.1, so {{project_name_workstation_short}} can reach it. It is filtered from outside due to whonix_firewall.
* added ucspi-tcp, contains tcpserver, required for Control Port Filter Proxy
* renamed whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/keys/tpoarchive-keys.d/readme to whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/keys/tpoarchive-keys.d/.readme so apt-key ignores it and doesn't throw an error
* renamed build-steps folder to build-steps.d
* added virt-what
* reorganized updating tpo package list, installing deb.torproject.org-keyring also on {{project_name_workstation_short}}, installing torsocks and tor in case the version in tpo repository is newer
* whonixcheck, timesync: fix, don't delete temporary folder too early
* whonixsetup: made it more robust, fix, enabled debugging
* whonix_workstation/usr/bin/torbrowser: fix mkdir when run from non-home folder
* {{project_name_gateway_short}}: only update debian (/etc/apt/sources.list) and torproject.org (/etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list) package lists for eventually installing newer Tor, torsocks, obfsproxy from torproject.org. (Only in case it is newer in torproject.org repository.)
* no longer store backups of grub.cfg in /boot/grub/, store it in /var/lib/whonix/grub-backup instead, so it can not confuse grub, if they change something some day
* added git to build dependencies
* new whonix_build_both script: small hack to build both virtual machines, as long as whonix_build does not support --all.
* not re-creating the packages, if nothing changed
* get version number from latest git tag while building from source code
* automatically add to debian changelog from which git head it was build
* new way to find out locally using {{project_name_short}} version (now using dpkg-query); automatically bumping upstream version of {{project_name_short}}, no longer bumping deb revision; deleted whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/version (no longer required)
* build-steps/1200_create-debian-packages: Only purge local repository before adding new packages, do not purge remote (production) repository.
* .gitignore: added debian/patches; added .pc
* build-steps/1200_create-debian-packages: allow without root and without --torgateway or --torworkstation switch
* Makefile: create lintian.log not in source folder but in its parent folder
* using git archive instead of tar for tarball creation
* new internal (repository) folder readme; new signature folder readme; new main folder readme; and upload scripts
* output

(adretemp82)

{{project_name_gateway_short}} and {{project_name_workstation_short}}

* whonix_shared/etc/apt/sources.list.whonix:
** out commented sources (deb-src)
** only using: "deb https://security.debian.org/debian-security/ stable/updates main contrib non-free" and
** deb "https://deb.debian.org/debian stable main contrib non-free"
** added comment: "#deb https://deb.debian.org/debian/ stable-updates main contrib non-free"
** technical comments
* If bare BARE_METAL is set to 1 (when using whonix_build with --bare-metal), skip scripts, which are not required for creating {{project_name_short}} with physical isolation, so physical isolation users can also use the whonix_build script.
* added tor-ctrl
* new man page: tor-ctrl
* whonixcheck, timsync: inform at cli, if we are still waiting for whonixcheck and/or timesync's results

{{project_name_gateway_short}}

* Control Port Filter Proxy: [[Dev/onion-grater|onion-grater, a Tor Control Port Filter Proxy, design documentation]]
* new man page: controlportfilt
* added tor-ctrl
* added firewall rules for Control Port Filter Proxy
* Control Port Filter Proxy: Lie when we are asked "GETINFO net/listeners/socks".

Source Code

* removed dependency for bc, no longer required for whonixcheck/timesync (using expr instead)
* added imagemagick, because it is required for /usr/bin/backgroundd
* whonix_workstation/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_gpgconf: added sanity test "sudo -u user gpg --gpgconf-test"
* build source code: better way to parse command line options
* deleted obsolete file whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_grub (now solved in chroot.d post script)
* deleted obsolete and neglected TODO file, see https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues for TODO
* installing from separate local apt repository when building from source code
* build-steps/1100_prepare-build-machine and development/{{project_name_short}}-Shared_packages: added haveged to build depends
* build-steps/1200_create-debian-packages: create local signing key for local APT repository, yes a signing key is also required for local installation from local package repository, see script comments
* help-steps/pre: added some colorful output
* added colored outputs to the build scripts debian/control: set priority of whonix-x-(packages|files|postinst) and (dummy)tor to important and made the other ones optional. This has the advantage, that if the user tries to remove an essential package, APT will loudly complain, while less important packages can be removed.
* debug-steps/interactive-chroot-img: mounting local APT repository, if already available (will fail open, if not)
* new variable dist_build_apt_codename
* added buildconfig.d configuration folder
* Extracted code for packaging {{project_name_short}} in debian/rules and made a rules-helper.bsh script, which I can maintain better.
* dummytor: renamed package tor to dummytor and use Provides: tor. This prevents {{project_name_gateway_short}} from fetching dummytor.
* renamed whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/chroot-scripts-post.d/70_sources to whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/chroot-scripts-post.d/75_sources, so it runs after all apt install actions
* renamed skip_scripts variable to WHONIX_BUILD_SKIP_SCRIPTS
* added WHONIX_BUILD_SKIP_SCRIPTS support to build-steps
* converted native debian package into non-native debian package; new help-steps/make-tarball for creating debian orig tarball
* added debian/watch
* whonix_gateway/usr/lib/whonix/whonixsetup/ft_m_1: no longer try to reload a Tor which is eventually not started
* renamed VERSION variable to WHONIX_BUILD_WHONIX_VERSION
* whonix_shared/usr/bin/whonix_repository: - support adding multiple keys in /usr/share/whonix/keys/whonix-keys.d/* - more simple and robust code for revoke_keys - tested everything
* now using debuild - now also signing packages - (local repository was already signed)
* moved local apt repository to whonix_binary folder so it is no longer in the source folder and won't get included in the source tarball
* added debug-steps/reprepro-wrapper
* new variable WHONIX_BUILD_UPGRADE_BUILD_MACHINE to turn off apt update and apt full-upgrade and setting dpkg --force-confold during build step "prepare build machine"
* clean up /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90whonix-build-confold at the end
* deleted whonix_shared/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20whonix-oldconfig, no longer required since we now have proper packaging
* debian/rules: also parse /etc/init.d folders for gateway and workstation
* add {{project_name_short}} apt repository to /etc/sources.list.d/whonix.list using the whonix_repository tool renamed variable DISTRUST_WHONIX_APT_REPO to WHONIX_APT_REPOSITORY_DISTRUST_ENV renamed variable WHONIX_APT_REPOSITORY_DISTRUST to WHONIX_APT_REPOSITORY_DISTRUST_CONFIG
* if the builder provides its own signing key in buildconfig.d WHONIX_LOCAL_SIGNING_KEY_FOLDER variable, use that key, otherwise use an automatically created signing key
* added repository upload script

(adretemp68)

{{project_name_gateway_short}} and {{project_name_workstation_short}}

* much work on an auto updater and packaging {{project_name_short}} for Debian
* added KDE Lowfat Settings
* improved many script output messages
* whonixcheck: code simplification; more robust progress_bar in corner cases.
* htpdate: 180 seconds for curl timeout as per https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-February/002635.html
* <s>An anonymous user suggested, that MAC addresses used by {{project_name_short}} starting with vendor prefix 080027 are too uncommon.; Used https://github.com/EtiennePerot/macchiato/tree/master/oui/wireless_laptop.sh (Integrated wireless interfaces in laptop computers) to find more popular MAC vendor ids.; Changed MAC addresses:</s>
** <s>{{project_name_gateway_short}} eth0 '00:26:82:47:5c:e1' (Gemtek Technology Co., Ltd. - HP Laptop)</s>
** <s>{{project_name_gateway_short}} eth1 '00:13:02:9c:f1:91' (Intel Corporate - Fujitsu Amilo Pi 1556 Notebook, Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Adapter)</s>
** <s>{{project_name_workstation_short}} eth0 '00:21:00:4d:8f:08' (GemTek Technology Co., Ltd. - HP Pavilion TX2510EA)</s>
* Added Time Sanity Check init script.
* /etc/apt/preferences.d/50_banned-packages
* Let htpdate wait for bootclockrandomization.
* whonixcheck and timesync: Warn if bootclockrandomization and/or timesanitycheck failed.
* Time Sanity Check before and after htpdate
* configuration folder /etc/systemcheck.d for .d-style configuration files
* added khelpcenter4 package
* added faketime package
* added timeprivacy script
* new man pages:
** uwt
** timesync
** time_privacy
** scurl
* /etc/kde4/kdm/kdmrc: Working around a rare bug, where kdm did not start because of a timeout by using higher timeout. https://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=45648
* new generic uwt/timeprivacy wrapper
* deleted old uwt wrappers
* using new generic uwt master wrapper /usr/bin/uwtwrapper instead of many copies of the same script
* fixed the bug where the uwt wrappers gave wrong arguments to curl and therefore broke applications dependent on curl, such as apt-file, update-flashplugin
* added libgl1-mesa-dri to prevent error (EE) AIGLX error: dlopen of /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/dri/swrast_dri.so failed (/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/dri/swrast_dri.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory) in /var/log/Xorg.0.log
* Removed xdg-utils, since we do not need them to create desktop icons and start menu entries.
* Check total RAM. If more than 512 MB &rarr; start KDE. If less (like 128 MB) &rarr; do not start KDE. This should be quite convenient, because users with low RAM could reduce ({{project_name_gateway_short}}) RAM to 128 MB and even if they sometimes wanted to configure/check something, they could assign 512 RAM and automagically boot into the graphical KDE desktop. There are also many settings in /etc/systemcheck.d/ to configure this feature, so if you want you can also add much RAM and still don't boot a desktop environment, use different display managers and so on.
* whonixcheck: now reading /etc/systemcheck.d/ configuration folder
* whonixcheck: added option WHONIXCHECK_NO_EXIT_ON_TRANS_PORT_DETECTION_FAILURE
* whonixcheck, timesync: bugfix: will now kill the process, if the cancel button in zenity is pressed
* added apparmor-profiles (but didn't enable enforce mode or added any useful profiles)
* added apparmor-utils (but didn't enable enforce mode or added any useful profiles)
* added /etc/default/grub
* higher console resolution 1024x768 (without X)
* enable "apparmor=1 security=apparmor" by default (but didn't enable enforce mode or added any useful profiles)
* more verbose output while booting, since on slow machines it may look like there is no progress otherwise
* reduced timeout from 300 to 180 to be on par with Tails
* added /usr/bin/whonix_repository which can be used to easily disable {{project_name_short}} APT repository

{{project_name_gateway_short}}

* first time connection wizard
* graphical {{project_name_gateway_short}} (got a KDE desktop now), wallpaper with most important information
* /etc/whonix_firewall.d/ for .d-style configuration files
* added option for Flash Proxy to firewall config in /etc/whonix_firewall.d/
* /etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list: Activated torproject.org Debian Wheezy repository, so obfs3 can be downloaded.
* added support for obfs3 out of the box
* new man pages:
** leaktest
** armwrapper
** {{project_name_short}} ** whonixsetup
* /usr/local/bin/whonix_firewall: comment for using Custom Open Ports on external interface
* added SocksPorts separate for KDE and GNOME wide applications
* /usr/bin/whonix_firewall: Port 9150 is no longer a custom port. It is now SOCKS_PORT_TBB_DEFAULT, supposed to be used by stock TBB running unmodified inside {{project_name_workstation_short}}.
* /usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf: added 127.0.0.1:9150 for consistency
* increased {{project_name_gateway_short}} RAM from 128 MB to 768 MB, because {{project_name_gateway_short}} becomes graphical
* arm wrapper to start arm without a password now passing command line arguments to arm
* arm wrapper also announces its existence when run because "set -x" is now set to avoid confusion
* Removed custom socks port 9151, because this is TBB's default Tor Control Port. Therefore we shouldn't train users to use it as custom socks port to avoid confusion.

{{project_name_workstation_short}}

* Added Boot Clock Randomization. This is useful before timesync succeeded, naturally timesync runs before timesync succeded, to make sure that the host clock and {{project_name_workstation_short}} clock differ.; Open for arguments if that should be added to {{project_name_gateway_short}} as well. See TimeSync design.
* added kmix
* added graphical alternatives manager, galternatives
* torbrowser: Deactivate tor-launcher, a Vidalia replacement as browser extension, to prevent running Tor over Tor. https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/6009 https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-launcher.git TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH=1
* XChat: No longer moving XChat plugins into a new folder. Using dpkg-divert instead to deactivate them. User documentation explains how to re-enable them.
* new man pages:
** xchat-reset
** torbrowser
** leaktest
** {{project_name_short}} ** whonix_firewall
* added proxy settings for KDE wide application
* torbrowser new --lang "language" command line option, see man torbrowser
* torbrowser: new option for advanced users --nokilltb

Source Code

* whonix_gateway/usr/local/bin/leaktest: using true instead of echo, since we set -x anyway
* whonix_gateway/usr/local/bin/leaktest: added comment in/out for "FascistFirewall 1".
* improved error handling
* code refactoring
* help-steps/pre: fewer useless debug output
* Gateway and Workstation: /etc/X0.hosts Add xhost exception, as required for zenity, since cron starts as root and whonixcheck (zenity) starts as user.
* better documented package lists
* shared: added debsums to package selection. Added a sanity check using debsums to the chroot-script 30_internal-checks.
* chroot-scripts-pre.d
* chroot-scripts-post.d
* postinst.d
* added skip_scripts variable
* No longer setting KDEDIRS in whonix_workstation/etc/environment. Using whonix_shared/etc/X11/Xsession.d/50whonix instead.
* WHONIX_TARGET_ARCH can now be set in build configuration
* {{project_name_gateway_short}} and {{project_name_workstation_short}}: Deleted /etc/sudoers.d/whonix and created multiple small files instead.
* new file release/list_source_files
* new build-step 32_verify_copied_files: checks if everything from the whonix_gateway/whonix_workstation and whonix_shared actually was correctly copied using diff.
* Added Tor Project Archive (0x886DDD89) key, which signs the deb.torproject.org repositories and archives as chroot script. It later gets updated by torproject keyring package.
* no longer required to mess with /etc/rc.local and /etc/environment so the user can easly edit without any conflicts with {{project_name_short}} configuration files (moved to /etc/profile.d/ instead)
* {{project_name_gateway_short}}, new chroot script, whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts-post.d/70_tor: downloading tor related software from Torprojects repository in case it contains newer software. At time of writing obfsproxy in Torprojects repository already contained obfs3 while Debian repository had only obfs2.
* whonix_shared/etc/apt/sources.list: changed from wheezy to stable, because wheezy became stable.
* gateway and workstation, package selection: Removed virtuoso-minimal, which was installed as workaround in 0787deb78d24678d87ef704ed206dd0b6b4d7e3e as dependency for nepomuk (nepomuk comes with kde-workspace). Since nepomuk now gets disabled, virtuoso is no longer required.
* deleted defunct chroot-script whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/40_variables, it never worked, variables set by it were ignored by following chroot-scripts. Those variables get set in /home/user/{{project_name_short}}/help-steps/variables.
* Disable uwt while building {{project_name_short}}, because it is not functional while building {{project_name_short}} from source code. Instead of doing this in every build and chroot script, do it in a central place, the help-steps/variables script.
* mass rename whonix_(gateway|workstation|shared)/usr/local/... to whonix_(gateway|workstation|shared)/usr/... ; mass rename /usr/local/... to /usr/...
* Removed line for changing partition uuid from build-steps/35_run-chroot-scripts-img, because it didn't really belong there and made it its own step build-steps/34_change_partition_uuid.
* We no longer place uwt wrappers into /usr/local/bin/<uwt-wrapped-application>. Therefore we now use dpkg-divert /usr/bin/<uwt-wrapped-application> to /usr/bin/<uwt-wrapped-application> and symlink /usr/bin/<uwt-wrapped-application> to /usr/bin/uwtwrapper.
* whonix_shared/usr/bin/scurl: better way to forward extra arguments, using <math>{1+"</math>@"} instead of $*
* whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/chroot-scripts-pre.d/70_banned_packages: Removed code 'echo "package-name hold" | dpkg --set-selections', because it is no longer necessary, we're now using /etc/apt/preferences.d/ instead.
* build-steps/10_prepare-build-machine: added ruby-ronn to build dependencies (required for creating man pages)
* whonixcheck, timesync: better handling of short and long options; -help &rarr; --help -autostart &rarr; --autostart -cron &rarr; --cron
* whonixcheck: now using whonix-keys.d folder
* whonixcheck, timesync: output and startup functions are now the same on {{project_name_gateway_short}} and {{project_name_workstation_short}}, since {{project_name_gateway_short}} is now graphical as well
* DummyTor now gets created along with the other packages in debian/control
* added two new help-steps prevent-daemons-from-starting and unprevent-daemons-from-starting, because the (un)chroot are ignored for bare-metal and preventing daemons from starting is still recommended for bare-metal.
* whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/apt.conf: changed ip from 192.168.0.11 to 127.0.0.1 to make it independent from host network configuration
* got rid of whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/apt.conf, using APT command line rather
* build-steps: using http_proxy variable for setting up apt-cacher-ng as proxy for grml-debootstrap
* build-steps/2600_export-vbox-vm: added --manifest (hashes which can be used to determine if the appliance components arrived intact)
* build-steps/2600_export-vbox-vm: also added --manifest, --product, --vendor, --vendorurl, --version (Not yet using: --producturl)
* Using config-package-dev to solve conflicts when {{project_name_short}} deb packages overwrite files owned by other packages.
* build-steps/2000_install-common-packages: prevent mounting /etc/resolv.conf from the host inside the chroot, /etc/resolv.conf from {{project_name_short}} source folder can get installed.;
* deleted whonix_workstation/etc/polipo/config (not installed, not in use)
* build-steps/1100_prepare-build-machine: - no longer installing dependencies for creating virtual machines for bare metal builds - no longer installing dependencies for bare metal builds for virtual machine builds - removed debootstrap as build dependency, because grml-debootstrap Depends on it and therefore automatically fetches it - removed git as build dependency, git is only required to download the source code but anyone who has the source code, doesn't need git (if not planing to contribute) - replaced qemu with qemu-utils, because that includes the required tools - code refactoring -
* build-steps/1300_create-debian-img: removed unneeded --keep_src_list option from grml-debootstrap#
* build-steps/2500_create-vbox-vm: removed hardware modifications, very little gain, while it breaks enabling uefi
* run update-grub while building {{project_name_short}} and fix /boot/grub/grub.cfg due to a known bug in grub
* new WHONIX_DEB_DEBUG variable
* install from local APT repository, no longer required to copy packages manually into the image
* update-rc.d $display_manager remove as dpkg post invoke hook, otherwise as soon as a display manager (kdm by default) get upgraded, its postinst script will revert {{project_name_short}} post chroot script and {{project_name_short}} feature, which deactivated the /etc/init.d/ autostart mechanism, what would break {{project_name_short}} feature to decide to start a display manager depending on free RAM and other configurable settings
* build-steps/1100_prepare-build-machine: speed up apt update
* help-steps/variables: removed deprecated SNAPSHOT_DESCRIPTION variable
* adding {{project_name_short}} APT repository signing key with apt-key while building {{project_name_short}}
(adretemp40)

{{project_name_workstation_short}}

* longer installing polipo by default. It is not required for anything.
* torbrowser: Added a meaningful error message, if the Tor Browser folder does not exist and recommend to run the updater in that case.

{{project_name_gateway_short}} and {{project_name_workstation_short}}

* Added /etc/hostname with content "host". Even though grml-debootstrap already creates /etc/hostname with content "host build-steps/35_run-chroot-scripts-img: added support for bare metal users.

Source Code

* torbrowser: merged tb_start function into tb_start_new_tab.

(0.6.1)

{{project_name_gateway_short}} and {{project_name_workstation_short}}

* timesync: added autostart status notification
* Added /etc/apt.conf.d/20oldconfig: never ask if a configuration file should get updated by dpkg. Always keep the locally installed one.
* Running whonixcheck after a random amount of time (minimum 60 seconds + a random number between 0 and 500) to make the network fingerprint less predictable.

{{project_name_gateway_short}}

* torrc, firewall: added port 9050

{{project_name_workstation_short}}

* workstation: Disable Apper's mechanism to automatically check for updates, to work around upstream bugs: - https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=62575 and https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=62576
* timesync: When timesync is run by cron.hourly (/usr/local/bin/htpdate_hourly), and there is nothing important to tell, say nothing. Otherwise there would be such a popup every hour.
* timesync: When timesync is automatically started and nothing important has to be reported, use kdialog --passivepopup, because that is non-intrusive and will automatically fade out. When timesync is manually started, always use zenity.
* timesync: No need for flashing a progress meter, if htpdate already succeeded.
* whonix_workstation/home/user/.bashrc: Do not "cat /etc/motd" on {{project_name_workstation_short}} login shell, only in virtual console. (Konsole)
* Workstation: Graphical notify-send notification that start of whonixcheck gets delayed.
* Workstation package selection: added libnotify-bin for whonixcheck.
* whonixcheck: Removed transitional popup, that whonixcheck is no longer autostarted at every boot of {{project_name_workstation_short}}.
* torbrowser: Downloading Tor Browser and signature from http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/dist/torbrowser/linux instead from https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser for better security when run inside {{project_name_short}}.
* torbrowser: Added --max-time 300 to signature download to defeat a endless data or slow retrieval attack.
* torbrowser: downloading signature file before Tor Browser itself. - Would be a pity to download Tor Browser (takes long) only to recognize, that the signature download (takes very little time) fails.
* whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/kde/share/applications/whonix-whonixcheck.desktop: improved icon description.
* torbrowser: Removed tb_create_user_js, since no longer required to change Tor Browser's proxy settings. (Now using rinetd.)
* torbrowser: Always starting Tor Browser with cd ~/tor-browser_"<math>TB_LANG"/ ~/tor-browser_"</math>TB_LANG"/App/Firefox/firefox --profile Data/profile instead of cd ~/tor-browser_"<math>TB_LANG"/ ~/tor-browser_"</math>TB_LANG"/start-tor-browser and therefore not starting Vidalia/Tor when the user manually downloaded or updated TBB.
* Workstation: Added rinetd. It prevents Tor over Tor by just installing Tor or by using the complete Tor Browser Bundle, which starts Vidalia and Tor.; This is because, it listens on port 9050 and 9150 and therefore lets a default Tor or TBB fail to start.; Fowards port 127.0.0.1:9050 (Workstation) to 192.168.0.10:9050 (Gateway). Fowards port 127.0.0.1:9150 (Workstation) to 192.168.0.10:9150 (Gateway).

Source Code

* whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/50_adduser-user: Not re-creating user "user", and therefore perhaps changing an existing password. That should support re-running the script and bare metal better.
* gateway firewall: renamed variable, GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMMING_SSH &rarr; GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMING_SSH; typo fixes
* renamed: whonix_shared/etc/profile.d/whonixcheck.sh &rarr; whonix_shared/etc/profile.d/20_whonixcheck.sh
* whonix_shared/usr/local/bin/delay: added small help file. It is required to prevent getting the logins sparred.
* whonix_shared/usr/local/bin/whonixcheck-scripts/15_kill-old-instances fixed
* whonixcheck: load help_output module earlier so it also works for the check_autostart module whonix_shared/usr/local/bin/whonixcheck-scripts/25_autostart: disable debugging
* build-steps/30_copy-into-img: Remove symlink /etc/localtime before copying to prevent "cp: <code>/usr/share/zoneinfo/UTC' and</code>/etc/localtime' are the same file" error.
* whonixcheck: better way to autostart
* timesync: added option for -autostart
* chown --recursive user:user &rarr; chown --recursive "<math>USERNAME":"</math>USERNAME"
* build-steps/15_prepare-build-machine: using "$USERNAME" instead of user
* chown --recursive user:user &rarr; chown --recursive "<math>USERNAME":"</math>USERNAME"
* more consistency: /home/"<math>USERNAME" &rarr; "</math>HOMEVAR"
* build-steps/15_prepare-build-machine: added creation of user "user".
* build-steps/20_create-debian-img: arch as variable $ARCH; comments for alternative architectures for custom builds
* help-steps/variables: added "export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive "
* Added new build step 15_prepare-build-machine to ease building from source.
* whonixcheck: removed redundant variable COUNTER
* torbrowser: using general trap; reduced code duplication by sourcing the tbbversion function
* whonixcheck: split the script, which had grown too big over time into many smaller scripts
* timesync: using whonixcheck error handler, reduced code duplication
* timesync: split timesync script into many smaller scripts and reduced code duplication comments
* help-steps/variables: Variable WHONIX_SOURCE_FOLDER supports now being used by different user than "user".
* whonix_build: Removed "chmod +x "$WHONIX_SOURCE_FOLDER"/build-steps/20_create-debian-img" - no longer required, no longer using the executable bit to decide which steps to run. This is now done using command line switches and variables.
* Fix: build script when not using as user "user" - deactivate trap before running the id command.
* release/whonix_release: Added --armor to gpg --detach-sign. .asc files look better (look like plain text) than .sig (look like binary).
* release/whonix_news: No longer required to update the version manually.; It is now read from whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/version.;
* release/upload_whonix_news: added automatic signing and verification to upload script.; deleted release/whonix_news.asc, since no longer required.
* upload_download_readme: Added automatic sign, verify to upload script.; release/README.asc deleted, since no longer required. release/whonix_release: comments
* release/upload_download_readme: Read version from /whonix_shared/usr/local/share/whonix/version. No longer required to manually edit version.
* whonixcheck: more modular, own function for get_local_whonix_version.
* whonixcheck: No longer hardcoding architecture variable ARCH. Now using uname.
* torbrowser: made the script more modular
* Not trying to creating any users (and thus changing their passwords), if these user accounts already exist. This should support (physical isolation) users better, who changed these passwords already. gateway torrc: using bridge for obfs bridge comment instead of Bridge - both work (tested), but since regular bridges are also already written in lowercase, it is more consistant. (bridges.torproject.org also uses "bridges" in lowercase.)

(0.6.0)

{{project_name_gateway_short}} and {{project_name_workstation_short}}

* Run update-command-not-found while building to prevent prompting the user "Please run update-command-not-found.".
* Prevent from installing: popularity-contest (privacy); geoclue (privacy); resolvconf (can mess up /etc/resolv.conf); ufw (can mess up firewall); and also for custom builds: canonical-census, unity-lens-shopping, unity-scope-video-remote, unity-scope-musicstores, geoclue-ubuntu-geoip; using dpkg hold; users who wish can overwrite those default banned packages which shouldn't be necessary for anyone but experts

{{project_name_gateway_short}}

* torrc: Added comment for mumble server onion service.

{{project_name_workstation_short}}

* Disable xchat plugins no longer with xchat-reset, only disable while building so the user is free to re-enable them.
* Removed redundant hiddenserver-install. No longer required. {{project_name_short}} documentation explains how to install it a hidden server.

Source Code

* Now easier to understand. More modular. New step based layout.
* Got rid of unclear whonix_internal_install_script. Chroot-Scripts are now in whonix_.../usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/.
* whonix_build -all -tg -tw -fast -tg-fast -fw-fast -clean -clean-tg -clean-tw
* Running whonix_build_clean "<math>MACHINE" before whonix_build_clean "</math>MACHINE", i.e. when running whonix_build -all/tg(-fast)/tw(-fast) won't break anymore if running whonix_build -clean(-tg/-tw) has been forgotten beforehand.
* Moved workstation specific icons to workstation folder.; Moved icons to /usr/local/share/whonix/icons/.; Moved gpg public keys to /usr/local/share/whonix/gpg-pubkeys/.
* chmod -x whonix_workstation/home/user/.bashrc
* Removed whonix_workstation/usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/70_audio, redundant on Debian/KDE, audio will work out of the box.
* torbrowser: No longer adding additional extensions.torbutton.banned_ports, it was always redundant.
* added /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99timeout to handle APT timeouts better
* workstation: added failsafe mechanism to {{project_name_short}} second, optional, extra firewall
* workstation: Creating the dummytor package while building {{project_name_short}}.
* Gateway: No longer required to set +i on /etc/resolv.conf. Removed. DHCP is configured to prevent overwriting it and resolvconf is a banned package.
* gateway: added /etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/nodnsupdate to prevent showing an error message while booting

= {{project_name_short}} 0.5.6 Changelog =

{{project_name_gateway_short}}

* Fixed a time zone bug, which prevented Tor to connect in some cases.

= {{project_name_short}} 0.5.5 Changelog =

{{project_name_gateway_short}} and {{project_name_workstation_short}}

* Fixed htpdate_hourly.
* whonixcheck: improved messages.
* whonixcheck: better method for Tor Browser local and remote version phrasing.
* uwt: Fixed a bug: "''libtorsocks(18790): Could not open socks configuration file (/tmp/tmp.pKSaitLYTN) errno (13), assuming sensible defaults for Tor.''"
* Deactivate automatic update check in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic. It is handled by whonixcheck. This makes fingerprinting {{project_name_short}} users harder.
* whonix_createvm: Disable clipboard sharing at build time. Only matters if guest additions are installed which is recommended against. Just in case.
* whonix_release: Removed sha sums. New versions will no longer contain sha sums. A more secure method, gpg signatures are provided.
* Enabled auto login on tty1 for {{project_name_gateway_short}} and {{project_name_workstation_short}}.
* Added haveged, which is an entropy gathering daemon.
* adrelanos.asc: changed e-mail address from proper at secure-mail dot biz to adrelanos@[outdated, redacted]. Key otherwise unchanged. Fingerprint remains the same. There is no need to update. Just mail to the my current riseup e-mail address.
* Installing command-not-found.<br />
* Removed redundant mdadm and lvm2 from package selection. Physical Isolation and other advanced users most likely know if they need those packages.

{{project_name_workstation_short}}

* easier to install [[Chat#TorChat|TorChat]]
* pre-installed [[Mixmaster]], a tool to send e-mail without registering e-mail accounts
* easier to install [[E-Mail#Mozilla_Thunderbird_with_TorBirdy|TorBirdy]]
* pre-installed rawdog, an rss reader to read {{project_name_short}} News Blogs
* autologin for kde user
* added [[Dev/Dummy Tor|Dummy Tor]] package
* whonixcheck: runs once a day.
* Leaktest script fixed.
* Added icons for {{project_name_short}} online readme, torbrowser, whonixcheck and timesync.
* installing kde-baseapps-bin package. It is required for KDE applications proxy settings. (Only for stream isolation, manually installed applications.)
* MAT, the [[Metadata]] Anonymisation Toolkit, now fully installed and therefore easier to use
* added GnuPG frontend: KGpg
* install accessibility tools
* install process manager: ksysguard
* {{project_name_workstation_short}} KDE settings:
** double click instead of single click
** kgpg settings hide user id and keyservers
** KGpg settings: Decided not to set hkp://2eghzlv2wwcq7u7y.onion as keyserver, because it was offline.
** Dolphin show menu bar
** Konsole unlimited scrollbag
** plasma-widget-folderview, which allows to show the content of the ~/Desktop folder on the desktop.
** kde desktop set to folderview by default to show desktop icons.
** set default wallpaper to /usr/share/wallpapers/stripes.png
** New icons and desktop shortcuts.
** {{project_name_short}} specifc start menu default icons.
* new /home/user/.bashrc - adds displaying /etc/motd (contains password and help) and bash completion.
* removed leafpad and kate. added kwrite as editor.
* whonixcheck: show "apt update && apt full-upgrade" again even if apper is available because apper has bugs. (unsigned package warning)
* torbrowser:
** wrapper script supports now -new-tab link.com, for example: torbrowser -new-tab https://www.startpage.com
** the script may no longer be run as root.
** can now be run as any user, not just as "user", but this is untested. Only tested for user "user".
** new -lang switch for language help.
** better error message if network is down and curl fails.
** more help if network is down or script is broken.
** added Tor Browser Updater icon
** added graphical progress meter.
** graphical user interface
** removed gpg key download code and move it to deprecated_code. Downloading the keys at Tor Browser update time from the keyservers was a relict from TorBOX times, where a build script created TorBOX. It was due to trust and space reasons to include only the gpg fingerprint and the gpg keyserver commands to download the key. Anyone using {{project_name_short}} binary builds or source code without audit already trusts {{project_name_short}}. Deploying the gpg public keys for Tor Browser download instead of downloading them from them keyservers adds no additional trust problem. Auditors can instead of comparing the gpg fingerprint, download they keys and compare them with the ones shipped with {{project_name_short}}. Not relying on the keyservers will make the Tor Browser update script much more robust.
** better and less scaring error message if torbrowser script bug is ever caught.
** Creating tor-browser_"$TB_LANG"/Docs/version. Tor Browser changelog has been forgotten to update by upstream. https://sourceforge.net/projects/whonix/discussion/general/thread/6122990d/ To play it safe and having a chance of finding out the installed version, we create a file ourselves to remember it.
** Fixed profile not found bug, in case Tor Browser wasn't fully loaded by hard coding to wait 30 seconds before trying to open extra tabs
* whonixcheck, torbrowser, htpdate: Notice Endless data attacks and Slow retrieval attacks by adding --max-time 300 to curl.

{{project_name_gateway_short}}

* package selection: installing tor-geooipdb. arm needs it to show countries.
* 0.4.5 undocumented: added settings to whonix_firewall, these were and are documented on the applications page
* whonixcheck
** now runs automatically at least every 24 hour on {{project_name_gateway_short}} as well.
** On {{project_name_gateway_short}}. Will now display the results when automatically run to all logged in users using the wall command.
** Also download {{project_name_short}} version and news file on the gateway for users using custom workstations.
* Fixed whonix_gateway/usr/local/bin/leaktest.
* Usability: arm can now be run without password.
* whonixcheck:

Source Code

* You can now just drop files inside the whonix_gateway, whonix_workstation or whonix_shared folders and don't need to add every single file inside int_copy_*.
* Faster debugging.
** new switch: whonix_createvm -t"$MACHINE"-copyimg required for building from source code...
** This eases debugging. Before we created the img using grml-debootstrap and directly copied into it and directly run the chroot script inside it. Creating a clean modification required to re-create the whole img using grml-debootstrap which always took a long time, even though using apt-cacher-ng. From now, only a copy of the img is modified. Using whonix_createvm -tg-copyimg (or -tw-copyimg) will copy the original img created by grml-debootstrap from /home/user/whonix_binary/"<math>VMNAME".img  to /home/"</math>USERNAME"/whonix_binary/"<math>VMNAME"_copy.img. Only/home/"</math>USERNAME"/whonix_binary/"$VMNAME"_copy.img gets modified from now.;
** whonix_build: added -fast switch, which skips the -createimg step
* whonix_createvm:
** only set Workstation hardware clock to UTC.
** No longer setting Gateway hardware clock to UTC.
*** This is because Tor leaks it to entry guards (and bridges?).
*** torproject.org #7277: timestamp leaked in TLS client hello https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/7277
*** torproject.org #4852: Clients send NETINFO with time https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/4852
** {{project_name_gateway_short}} is therefore less fingerprintable.

* torbrowser: Removed old comments.
* torbrowser: i686 to "$ARCH"

* torbrowser: #for commented out commands; ## for comments
* torbrowser: code refactoring. Removed redundancy of downloading the update information twice. Improved comments and echos.
* torbrowser: No longer deleting Tor/Vidalia from the downloaded TBB package. No longer trying to safe space. The wasted space is minimal, while this could have unforeseen consequences.
* torbrowser: gpg fingerprints are now inside variables. Fingerprints and how to verify them is now noted in echos.
* torbrowser: use more variables for download links. Now just one comment has to be removed to download from .onion instead.
* torbrowser: removed old out commented code for deleting stuff.
* torbrowser: simpler startup script creation method and fixed a quote bug.
* torbrowser: using rm --force to suppress error messages.
* torbrowser: deleting TorBrowser_installation_FAILED in case it was created earlier.
* torbrowser: ed editor startup script modification method comment removed.
* torbrowser: many changes. Added a graphical user interface
* torbrowser: comments; echos.
* torbrowser: new startup script creation method and fixes a quote bug.

* many code simplifications and code refactoring
* added /etc/environment for Tor Browser
* {{project_name_workstation_short}}_packages: marked non essential packages, which are safe to remove and which could make a complete operating system with ## LITE; shuffle; revised comments.
* Workstation package selection: added and unfortunately commented out software-center due to too many bugs which make it unusable https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=software-center
* {{project_name_gateway_short}}_packages, {{project_name_workstation_short}}_packages: added sysvinit-utils and bsdutils. Dependencies for whonixcheck.
* LICENSE
** Moved picture licenses to {{project_name_short}}-documentation repository.;
** "Except in this file or in files where otherwise noted, content in this the {{project_name_short}} source package is licensed under {{project_name_short}} source code license."
** improved formatting
** added links to webcitation.org
* removed doc backup, created extra repository https://github.com/adrelanos/{{project_name_short}}-documentation
* Renamed start-torbrowser to start-tor-browser. The {{project_name_short}} specific name start-torbrowser was too confusing.
* /etc/inittab: using getty instead of login. getty does not break {{project_name_short}} | more.

= {{project_name_short}} 0.4.5-fix2 =

[0.4.5-fix] for testers.

This is just a hotfix for torbrowser and whonixcheck. The Tor Browser locally installed version check was broken, because The Tor Project forgot to update the changelog and because the keyserver was offline. The torbrowser and the whonixcheck scripts now use a more robust method. ([https://sourceforge.net/projects/whonix/discussion/general/thread/6122990d/ Bug report and discussion])

* fixes torbrowser udpate script
* fixes whonixcheck
* fixes timesync command

= {{project_name_short}} 0.4.5-fix1 =

== All Platforms ==

=== AppArmor ===

* Fixed the Tor Browser AppArmor profile to allow correct functionality. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T672</ref>
* Resolved AppArmor conflicts affecting Pidgin, Chromium and Evince. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T314</ref>
* Merged AppArmor profiles for sdwdate, timesync and whonix-check into their corresponding packages and now install them by default. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T201</ref>

=== Bug Fixes ===

* Fixed broken whonix-setup-wizard functionality. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T499</ref>

=== Code ===

* Updated {{project_name_short}} code for Tor Browser tb-updater. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T666</ref>
* Refactored the {{project_name_short}} socks redirection firewall rules to reduce their size and use less script code. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T465</ref> <ref>The same firewall rules are still applied.</ref>
* Refactored {{project_name_short}} code so that scripts only use configuration files that end with the .conf extension. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T286</ref>

=== Improved Functionality and Usability ===

* Modified whonixcheck to test for slow or fast system clocks which prevent Tor from properly connecting. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T482</ref>
* Implemented an explicit check for timekeeping watchdog kernel messages in whonixcheck, so users are warned about clock jumps which prevent / time-out Tor connections. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T480</ref>
* Enforced maximized terminal windows for xdg desktop users. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T451</ref> <ref>For instance, tor-arm, restart Tor and other terminal programs.</ref>
* Enabled Transparent Proxy Ports for {{project_name_gateway_short}} by default (except for {{project_name_short}}-Firewall). <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T435</ref> <ref>This does not enable transparent proxying by default, but is required in Qubes so [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T434 tinyproxy traffic can be redirected] to 127.0.01 instead of to qubes-netvm-gateway.</ref>
* Configured {{project_name_short}} to use ''/etc/skel'' instead of writing to the home folder directly to maintain forward compatibility with Qubes. Further, this allows for proper error-handling where "user" is hardcoded in {{project_name_short}}, and a newly created account with a different name has been used. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T419</ref>
* Deprecated the timesync progress bar and replaced it with a tray icon using sdwdate-gui to improve usability and reduce confusion. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T300</ref>
* Created a stable-proposed-updates repository for users who want to help in testing {{project_name_short}} fixes, without resorting to the testers repository which comes with many more changes. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T200</ref>
* Moved the WhonixBackupScript to the usability-misc package to make it more accessible. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T159</ref>
* Replaced XChat with HexChat, since the former is no longer actively maintained, and created a new AppArmor profile to contain it. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T40</ref>
* Implemented a VPN_FIREWALL feature as part of whonix-ws-firewall. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T158</ref>

=== Security Enhancements ===

* Created a security-misc package that turns off Nautilus and Dolphin file previews by default, since this poses security risks. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T418</ref>
* A known, good version of Tor is now maintained and uploaded to the {{project_name_short}} repository from deb.torproject.org <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T472</ref>
* Uploaded the Tor 0.3.2.9 major (stable) release to the {{project_name_short}} repository to enable full v3 onion functionality for both hosting of onion services and access to v3 onion addresses in Tor Browser. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T764</ref>
* Extended the lifetime of the {{project_name_short}} signing key. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T497</ref>
* Sourced new onion services webservers for the sdwdate feature, which ensures the system's clock is correctly set for security, privacy and anonymity purposes. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T266</ref>

== {{q_project_name_long}} ==

=== Bug Fixes ===

* Fixed qubes-whonix-firewall systemd service start. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T528</ref> <ref>This fixes various bugs relating to Tor starting / failing multiple times and qubes-whonix-torified-updates-proxy sometimes failing.</ref>
* Resolved whonixcheck fixes for Qubes R4. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T724</ref>
* Corrected false positive failure messages for the updates proxy test in Qubes R4. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T723</ref> <ref>Qubes R4 RC1.</ref>
* Disabled qubes-SetDateTime / qubes.SyncNtpClock in {{q_project_name_short}} VMs since it interfered with timesync. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T384</ref>
* Resolved accumulation of old Tor Browser instances in ''/var/cache/tb-binary/.tb/'' which caused users to run into full disk error messages. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T671</ref>
* Resolved an occasional error message whereby {{project_name_short}} templates incorrectly reported they were not connected to the {{project_name_gateway_short}} ProxyVM. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T496</ref>
* Resolved the broken anon-ws-disable-stackedtor function in [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_short}}]]. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T454</ref>
* Enforced the opening of all links from <code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code>, <code>whonix-gw</code> and <code>whonix-ws</code> in the <code>{{project_name_workstation_vm}}</code> AppVM to prevent error messages. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T452</ref>

=== Builds ===

* Corrected the build failure of {{project_name_workstation_short}} template in {{q_project_name_short}} R3.2 and added the qubes-template-whonix to continuous integration service TravisCI. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T527</ref>
* Resolved {{project_name_short}} template build failures in Qubes R4 related to Tor Browser downloads. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T710</ref>
* Changed the {{q_project_name_short}} build process to install {{project_name_short}} from the {{project_name_short}} binary APT repository. This simplifies code, results in faster builds, removes build dependencies inside the template, and reduces the overall template size. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T498</ref>
* Allowed the {{project_name_short}} build script to run as root and reworked user_name. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T416</ref>

=== Code ===

* Removed fetching of {{project_name_short}} source code in qubes-template-whonix. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T507</ref>
* Removed the qubes-update-check system service from {{q_project_name_short}} Templates, since it was unnecessary. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T433</ref> <ref>The qubes-update-check.service already has improved upgrade notifications.</ref>
* Reworked / removed a number of installed packages in {{q_project_name_short}} which are only required for the [[Non-Qubes-Whonix|{{non_q_project_name_short}}]] desktop. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T429</ref> <ref>For instance, plasma-widget-folderview, kde-kdm-autologin, split the anon-shared-desktop-kde package and so on.</ref>
* Removed the default username and password in the {{q_project_name_short}} terminal, because it is not required. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T428</ref>

=== Improved Functionality and Usability ===

* Ported whonixcheck and tb-updater to Qubes' qrexec-based updates proxy, since Templates are non-networked by default in Qubes R4. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T491</ref>
* Changed the tb-updater configuration to use Qubes updates proxy, since Qubes R4 sets the NetVM of Templates to none by default. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T477</ref>
* Implemented the ability to install {{project_name_workstation_short}} and {{project_name_gateway_short}} from dom0 with a <code>sudo apt install whonix-(workstation|gateway)</code> feature. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T461</ref>
* Ported the bind-directories functionality upstream to Qubes. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T414</ref>
* Implemented the new bind-directories functionality in [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_short}}]]. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T501</ref>
* Implemented a check for whether the <code>whonix-gw</code> ProxyVM (<code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code>) has a NetVM which is set to "none", with a warning shown if this is the case. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T421</ref>
* Implemented a new feature so that following an update of the {{project_name_workstation_short}} Template, newly created AppVMs based on the updated Template come with an up-to-date version of Tor Browser. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T417</ref>
* Modified whonixcheck to check if: {{project_name_gateway_short}} is running in a NetVM or ProxyVM; {{project_name_workstation_short}} is running in an AppVM; and to skip the test if a Template is detected. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T406</ref>

=== Security Enhancements ===

* Prevented ''/usr/lib/qubes/qubes-setup-dnat-to-ns'' from running in {{q_project_name_short}} to stop it from modifying firewall rules. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T502</ref>

= {{project_name_short}} 14 Changelog =

{{project_name_short}} 14 was released on August 6, 2018. Significantly, {{project_name_short}} 14 is based on the Debian stretch (Debian 9) distribution which was released in mid-2017, instead of Debian jessie (Debian 8). <ref>https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/</ref> Users now have access to numerous updated and new software packages, a more modern branch of GnuPG, and more. <ref>https://www.debian.org/News/2017/20170617</ref> <ref>https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/release-notes/</ref> <ref>https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/release-notes/</ref>

* Ported anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor to systemd socket activation to remove unnecessary, idle socat listeners. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T623</ref> <ref>This also reduces the RAM load caused by too many socat instances.</ref>
* Removed auditd configuration folder parsing ''/etc/audit/rules.d/'' by default, since the feature has been implemented upstream.
* Implemented anonymous counting of {{project_name_short}} users via the whonixcheck {{project_name_short}} News function. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T689</ref> <ref>This measure takes place over Tor using a v3 onion. It does not include collection of IP addresses or unique identifiers of any kind, and can be [https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Systemcheck_Hardening#Prevent_Kicksecure_%E2%84%A2_Warrant_Canary_Check_and_User_Census_Counting easily disabled].</ref>
* Implemented, but did not activate changes to the {{project_name_short}} firewall so: sdwdate is stopped before suspend; timesync-fail-closed mode is set before suspend; sdwdate is restarted after resume; and {{project_name_short}} firewall enters full mode after resume following successful sdwdate activation. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T551</ref>
* Configured auditd to process the configuration folder ''/etc/audit/rules.d/'' by default to aid debugging. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T535</ref> <ref>https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=833474</ref>
* Implemented monitoring of changes to ''/var/lib/tor/lock'' access rights via auditd to aid debugging. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T537</ref>

* Removed the Control Port Filter Proxy script from anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor since it is no longer required for proper Tor connections or Tor Browser functions (its functionality is now replaced by [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/onion-grater onion-grater]). This means [[Next|Ricochet, Zeronet]] and [[OnionShare|OnionShare]] are now compatible with {{project_name_short}}. <ref>OnionShare is not installed by default in {{project_name_short}} 14 because it is not in the stretch repository, however it may be manually installed using the [[OnionShare#Installation|available wiki instructions]].</ref> <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T657</ref> <ref>[https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/onion-grater onion-grater]: <blockquote>Filters out Tor control protocol commands that are dangerous for anonymity such as GETINFO ADDRESS using a whitelist. Acts as a proxy between the client application and Tor. <br /><br />
For example it allows using Tor Browser's New Identity feature on Anonymity Distribution Workstations, fixes Tor Browser's about:tor default homepage and Tor Button status indicator without exposing commands that are dangerous for anonymity.</blockquote></ref>
* Installed necessary dependencies for proper ZeroNet functionality. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T701</ref>
* Installed onioncircuits by default in {{project_name_gateway_short}}. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/onioncircuits-viewing-the-status-and-circuits-of-tor/2539</ref>
* Added <code>--list-interface</code> to tor-controlport-filter, as it works better with dynamic IP addresses. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T579</ref>
* Added a ''/etc/tor-controlport-filter.d'' configuration extension feature. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T576</ref>
* Fixed the control-port-filer-python configuration to rewrite HS_DESC replies by Tor, so OnionShare is supported. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T574</ref>
* Merged the tor-controlport-filter by Tails for various enhancements. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T573</ref>
* Implemented more user-friendly error messages (instead of tb-starter error handlers) when non-{{project_name_short}} related Tor Browser issues cause start-tor-browser to fail and exit zero. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T510</ref>
* Implemented sane built-in defaults for whonix-gw-firewall, whonix-ws-firewall, whonixcheck, sdwdate, uwt, onion-grater, rads, open-link-confirmation, tb-starter and tb-updater, even if configuration files do not exist. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T503</ref>
* Changed uwt to set AllowOutboundLocalhost / AllowInbound which can help make servers utilizing Tor onion services work. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T357</ref>
* Implemented a sd_notify watchdog feature for onion-grater so the service is restarted if it appears to be running, but has became unresponsive. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T274</ref>
* Created a bindp {{project_name_short}} package to enable {{project_name_workstation_short}} applications that use Tor ephemeral onion services to bind on all interfaces as necessary. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T561</ref>
* Modified sdwdate to check if the clock is changed "behind the back" of the program and suggest a manual user fix. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T481</ref>
* Improved default torsocks information / warning messages when wrapped commands are invoked to reduce user confusion. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T73</ref>
* Both [[Non-Qubes-Whonix|{{non_q_project_name_short}}]] and {{q_project_name_short}} are now compatible with the Tor Project's sandboxed Tor Browser. <ref>This is no longer recommended, since the The Tor Project has ceased development and [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/25540 stopped building and distributing sandboxed-tor-browser binaries].</ref>

=== Security Enhancements ===

* Confirmed functionality of the kloak anti-keystroke deanonymization tool in {{project_name_short}}. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T583</ref> <ref>By default, kloak is packaged in {{project_name_short}} 15 for the {{non q project name short}} platform. Unfortunately {{q_project_name_short}} is unsupported (dysfunctional) due to the following Qubes issues: <br />
* https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/2558
* https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1850</ref>
* Identified more reliable onion servers as appropriate time sources for sdwdate, which enables correct network time synchronization for anonymity-focused distributions.  <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T647</ref>
* Implemented Tails' Control Port Filter Proxy in {{project_name_short}} and merged recent changes since it was forked. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T617</ref> <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T612</ref>
* Fixed security and hardening (stack canary) issues with the bindp libindp.so package (which were merged upstream). <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T599</ref>
* Uploaded Tor version 0.3.3.9 (stable) release to the {{project_name_short}} repository to enable full v3 onion functionality for both hosting of onion services and access to v3 onion addresses in Tor Browser. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T764</ref>
* Onion sources are now preferred for {{project_name_short}} updates/upgrades for greater security. Note: this change has been reverted due to the unreliable nature of onion connections at present - see footnote. <ref>Previously both clearnet and onion sources were in use and priority was given to the latter, with v3 onion connections being preferred (clearnet provided a fallback). Onions will not be set by default until [https://gitlab.torproject.org/asn/onionbalance OnionBalance] is available for v3 onions, and the repositories can be reached reliably.</ref>
* Disabled the apt-timer in Debian stretch to prevent auto updates, thereby preventing the attendant security risks associated with background updates without user input. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T590</ref>
* Disabled nautilus previews by default due to the security risks. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T500</ref>
* Implemented uwt to set TORSOCKS_ISOLATE_PID in Debian Stretch so all uwt wrapped applications are stream isolated. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T356</ref>
* Implemented tor+http / apt-transport-tor rather than Acquire::BlockDotOnion "false" for better security and stream isolation. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T610</ref>
* Disabled the systemd DNS resolver feature in order to reduce the attack surface and to remove the potential for adverse anonymity impacts. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T471</ref>
* Established a dedicated {{project_name_short}}.org repository, with appropriate redirects from {{project_name_short}} mirrors. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T475</ref>
* Removed the DHCP client from {{project_name_gateway_short}} and switched to a static network configuration so the dhclient is no longer present on all interfaces, including the internal network. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T559</ref>
* Disabled VLC metadata collection by default. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T736</ref>
* Disabled "Obey DRM limitations" in Okular, <ref>The default {{project_name_short}} PDF reader.</ref> since Digital Rights Management (DRM) can be used as a tracking vector. <ref>https://www.locklizard.com/track-pdf-monitoring/</ref> <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T776</ref>

=== Improved Functionality and Usability ===

* Created the <code>grub-live</code> package which can [[VM_Live_Mode|run {{project_name_short}} as a live system]]. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T714</ref> <ref><code>grub-live</code> is not installed by default in {{project_name_short}} 14 and is an optional package only.</ref>
* Added Kscreen to {{project_name_short}} by default in order to allow DPI scaling and other basic desktop features of Plasma 5. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T703</ref>
* Removed the VirtualBox shared folder and confirmed automounting of shares is enabled in Debian stretch. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T702</ref>

=== Security Enhancements ===

* Removed okular from anon-shared-applications-kde to anon-workstation-default-applications so it is not installed on {{project_name_gateway_short}}. <ref>https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/anon-meta-packages/commit/a22b1807c79cb1d21447c83ed251c331cf6222f1</ref>
* Hide the CPUID in VirtualBox 5 by setting generic values via <code>HostCPUID</code>. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T408</ref>

== Website Fixes and Outreach ==

* Website fixes: implemented the proposed download directory structure as well as download redirects, stable download links and permalinks. <ref>This greatly assists with documentation efforts, since documentation does not break and need updating based on a new point release being available.</ref>
* Implemented numerous mediawiki fixes for better website presentation. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T809</ref>
* Opened a Peertube video channel. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T870</ref> <ref>{{project_name_short}} already has a Youtube channel, but Peertube provides a further avenue for information on new/fresh projects.</ref>
* Updated [[Dev/Redistribution#Announcement|Release Announcements]] to collate all places where this should be posted. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T847</ref>

== All Platforms ==

=== AppArmor ===

* Corrected the dnscrypt-proxy AppArmor profile for full functionality.
* Removed unnecessary and extensive capabilities from the Tor Browser AppArmor profile. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/why-does-the-tor-browser-apparmor-profile-have-sys-admin-sys-chroot-and-ptrace-capabilties/7409</ref> <ref>https://github.com/Kicksecure/apparmor-profile-torbrowser/pull/6</ref> <ref><blockquote>The Tor Browser AppArmor profile has capability sys_admin, capability sys_chroot, and ptrace. This looks pretty insecure.

ptrace will allow the Tor Browser to modify and inspect other running processes.

sys_admin will allow the Tor Browser to do a whole load of things that it probably shouldn’t be able to.

sys_chroot will allow the Tor Browser to chroot which can make an attacker able to put a setuid program inside a chroot jail with a fake /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow which can fool it into giving it root access.</blockquote></ref>
* Amended the Tor Browser AppArmor profiles so 8.* versions correctly launch. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/tor-browser-8-wont-launch/5863</ref> <ref>https://github.com/Kicksecure/apparmor-profile-torbrowser/commit/5b1550cc51d73652d63af1fd010d9beb34e2069e</ref>

* Added a wildcard for non-Tor or modified Tor Browser Bundles. <ref>https://github.com/Kicksecure/apparmor-profile-torbrowser/pull/3</ref> <ref>This allows the same apparmor profile to be used for i2p browser (~/.i2pb/i2p-browser) or for a hypothetical ZeroNet browser (~/.zerob/zeronet-browser/) and so on.</ref>
* Deprecated /etc/apparmor.d/home.tor-browser.start-tor-browser due to broken functionality. <ref>https://github.com/Kicksecure/apparmor-profile-torbrowser/commit/21c36545df427bd8943a92279af78e53ea627056</ref>
* Added various permissions to the XChat AppArmor profile for greater functionality. <ref>https://github.com/Kicksecure/apparmor-profile-hexchat/pull/2</ref>

=== Bug Fixes ===

* Implemented an automated /var/lib/tor permission fix. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T855</ref> <ref>whonixcheck runs as user whonixcheck, so a wrapper might be needed which is called using sudo (with a sudoers.d exception for this test).</ref>

* Re-implemented Tor Browser local version number detection. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T400</ref>
* Decided against virtualizer configurations which attempt to hide the CPU model. <ref>Such as <code>--cpuid-portability-level</code> or <code>--cpuidremoveall</code> in VirtualBox, since the attempts have proven futile or even posed security risks.</ref> <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T408</ref> <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T881</ref>
* Moved kcalc, okular, gwenview, kgpg, libkf5kipi31.0.0 and libkf5kipi-data from hardened-desktop-applications-kde to non-qubes-whonix-workstation-kde and qubes-whonix-workstation. <ref>https://github.com/Whonix/anon-meta-packages/commit/04851c3ef4a5fa4e4e25917860392273b80a3ebb</ref>

* Allow multiple flashproxy ports in Whonix firewall. <ref>One example implementation is to use iptables to force all traffic through those ports. This requires two flashproxy ports -- one for TCP traffic and one for DNS.</ref> <ref>https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-firewall/commit/5ffcbb5ad30b04a6c5ea57734a8907cdc08c9b9f</ref> <ref>https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-firewall/commit/6882aa9a449e0b6317f96f35d54ddcfcf56df858</ref> <ref>https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-firewall/commit/5cf35f4ffe9d2f7ff2d2f8200dd0f2ad82ea5f14</ref>

* Removed mapaddress entries in torrc for 1.1.1.1 and 2.2.2.2 due to the fingerprinting risk. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T878</ref> <ref>Otherwise this redirects and discloses the traffic to onion addresses.</ref>
* Run whonixcheck in Whonix-Workstation on first time boot. <ref>https://phabricator.whonix.org/T821</ref> <ref>whonixcheck will now always run and check for updates on first boot of Whonix-Workstation since numerous updates will likely be available, including kernel updates.</ref>

Kexec is disabled as it can be used for live patching of the running kernel.

The BPF JIT compiler is restricted to the root user and is hardened.

ASLR effectiveness for mmap is increased.

The ptrace system call is restricted to the root user only.

The TCP/IP stack is hardened.

This package makes some data spoofing attacks harder.

SACK is disabled as it is commonly exploited and is rarely used.

This package disables the merging of slabs of similar sizes to prevent an attacker from exploiting them.

Sanity checks, redzoning, and memory poisoning are enabled.

The kernel now panics on uncorrectable errors in ECC memory which could be exploited.

Kernel Page Table Isolation is enabled to mitigate Meltdown and increase KASLR effectiveness.

SMT is disabled as it can be used to exploit the MDS vulnerability.

All mitigations for the MDS vulnerability are enabled.

DCCP, SCTP, TIPC and RDS are blacklisted as they are rarely used and may have unknown vulnerabilities.</blockquote></ref>

=== Kernel and Related Hardening ===

Significant [https://forums.whonix.org/t/kernel-hardening/7296/140 kernel] and other security hardening has been implemented; numerous enhancements have been made to [https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc security-misc]: <ref>https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/compare/a99dfd067ac8a43bdcd779cf57b3533bdaa404fb...163e20b886f298cb9d3aca54c14f66991001b396</ref>
* Enabled kernel panic on kernel oops after boot, see: [https://forums.whonix.org/t/set-oops-panic-kernel-parameter-or-kernel-panic-on-oops-1-sysctl-for-better-security/7713 set oops=panic kernel parameter or kernel.panic_on_oops=1 sysctl for better security].
* Enabled <code>pam_umask.so</code> usergroups, so group permissions are the same as user permissions. <ref>By default, Debian utilizes [https://wiki.debian.org/UserPrivateGroups User Private Groups (UPG)]. Also see: <code>/usr/share/pam-configs/usergroups-security-misc</code></ref>
* Removed read, write and execute access for others for all users who have home folders under folder /home. <ref>For example, this affects those running “chmod o-rwx /home/user” during package installation or an upgrade.</ref> <ref>This is only performed once for each folder in the parent /home folder, so users who wish to relax file permissions can do so. This action protects files in the user's home folder which were previously created with lax file permissions prior to the installation of this package.</ref>
* Group sudo membership is required to use <code>su</code>.
* [[Root#Passwordless_Recovery_Mode_Security_Discussion|Passwordless]], [[Recovery|recovery / emergency mode]] has been implemented.
* Lock user accounts with <code>pam_tally2</code> after five failed authentication attempts are detected. <ref>See: [[Recovery#Unlock_User_Account:_Excessive_Wrong_Password_Entry_Attempts|unlock instructions]]. This means it is possible to have short, easy-to-remember, "weak" passwords for the user <code>user</code> account, while still preventing compromised non-root users from bruteforcing it.</ref>
* Fix <code>pam_tally2</code> check when read-only disk boots without ro-mode-init or grub-live.
* The thunderbolt and firewire modules were blacklisted, since they can be used for Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks.
* Every module must now be signed before being loaded; any module that is unsigned or signed with an invalid key cannot be loaded. <ref>This makes it harder to load a malicious module.</ref>
* Uncommon network protocols were blacklisted: these are rarely used and may have unknown vulnerabilities. <ref>See: /etc/modprobe.d/uncommon-network-protocols.conf</ref>
* Enabled [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input%E2%80%93output_memory_management_unit IOMMU].
* The SysRq key is restricted to only allow shutdowns/reboots.
* [https://forums.whonix.org/t/sysrq-magic-sysrq-key/8079 Restrict] the [[SysRq]] key so it can only be used for shutdowns and the Secure Attention Key.
* A systemd service mounts /proc with <code>hidepid=2</code> at boot, thereby preventing users from seeing each other’s processes.
* A systemd service clears System.map on boot as these contain kernel symbols that could be useful to an attacker. <ref>[https://forums.whonix.org/t/kernel-hardening/7296/130 Forum discussion].</ref>
* Remove System.map after a kernel upgrade.
* remove-system-map: use shred instead of rm.
* The kernel logs are restricted to root only.
* The BPF JIT compiler is restricted to the root user and is hardened.
* The ptrace system call is restricted to the root user only.
* Added user <code>root</code> to group sudo. This is necessary so it is still possible to login as a user in a virtual console. <ref>See: debian/security-misc.postinst</ref>
* Kernel symbols in <code>/proc/kallsyms</code> are hidden. This prevents malware from reading and using them to learn more about system vulnerabilities that can be attacked.
* Kexec is disabled because it can be used for live patching of the running kernel.
* Bluetooth is blacklisted to reduce the attack surface.
* Added experimental [https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/SUID_Disabler_and_Permission_Hardener SUID Disabling and Permission Hardening]: <ref>[https://forums.whonix.org/t/disable-suid-binaries/7706 Disable SUID Binaries]</ref> <ref>https://github.com/Whonix/anon-apps-config/compare/a6a6c2ed3c58ef5b023866a8aed4ae1996d93420...9cbfad0aa30ce2014b65d997007baa3bf26005ca#diff-44b21d78d2546f10b7f1ba806e28e1f1</ref>

** <code>spectre_v2=on</code>

** <code>tsx=off</code>
** <code>tsx_async_abort=full,nosmt</code>
* The MSR kernel module is blacklisted to prevent CPU MSRs from being abused to write to arbitrary memory.
* Vsyscalls are disabled as they are obsolete, are at fixed addresses and are a target for ROP.
* Page allocator freelist randomization is enabled.
* The vivid kernel module is blacklisted as it is only required for testing and has been the cause of multiple vulnerabilities.
* An initramfs hook sets the sysctl values in <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> and <code>/etc/sysctl.d</code> before init is executed so sysctl hardening is enabled as early as possible.
* The kernel panics on oopses to prevent it from continuing to run a flawed process and to deter brute forcing.
* Improve entropy collection: <ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDRAND#Reception RDRAND reception]</ref> <ref>https://twitter.com/pid_eins/status/1149649806056280069</ref>

* Only allow symlinks to be followed when outside of a world-writable sticky directory, or when the owner of the symlink and follower match, or when the directory owner matches the symlink’s owner. Prevent hardlinks from being created by users that do not have read/write access to the source file. These prevent many TOCTOU races:
