{{IntroLike|
The {{project_name_short}} Windows Installer streamlines the process of setting up {{project_name_short}} on VirtualBox. While the earlier method required users to follow instructions on the [[VirtualBox|{{project_name_short}} for VirtualBox]] wiki page, this installer makes the entire process more intuitive. Here's an in-depth look at what it does:
}}

{{{!}} class="wikitable" style="background-color: #fff;text-align: left"
! '''Question'''
! '''Answer'''
{{!}}-

{{!}} What is the purpose of the {{project_name_short}} Windows Installer?
{{!}} The {{project_name_short}} Windows Installer was developed with design goals focused on providing users with a fast and easy method to install {{project_name_short}} in Microsoft Windows. When <code>{{project_name_short}}-Xfce-{{VersionNew}}.exe</code> is executed, the [[VirtualBox/Recommended_Version|Recommended VirtualBox version]] and both {{project_name_short}} VMs are seamlessly installed on the Windows machine. Once {{project_name_short}} is installed, users only need to click the start button in the {{project_name_short}} GUI for both {{project_name_gateway_long}} and {{project_name_workstation_long}} VMs to start.
{{!}}-

{{!}} What happens if VirtualBox is already installed?
{{!}} When the {{project_name_short}} Windows Installer is executed, the currently installed VirtualBox package -- if there is one installed on the system -- is removed and the VirtualBox version that comes with {{project_name_short}} Windows Installer is installed.
{{!}}-

{{!}} Do I have to use the new {{project_name_short}} Windows Installer?
{{!}} No. You can still manually install VirtualBox and import {{project_name_short}} by following the instructions on the [[VirtualBox{{!}}{{project_name_short}} for VirtualBox]] wiki page.
{{!}}-

{{!}} Can a newer version of VirtualBox be installed after using {{project_name_short}} Windows Installer?
{{!}} Yes. [[Reasons_for_Freedom_Software#No_Intentional_User_Freedom_Restrictions|There are no intentional user freedom restrictions]]. The user is free to install, update or uninstall VirtualBox at any time.
{{!}}-

{{!}} Is the manual method for VirtualBox installation going to be deprecated?
{{!}} There's no such plan as of now. The manual method remains crucial as it offers compatibility with certain Linux distributions not supported by the [[Linux|{{project_name_short}} Linux Installer]].
{{!}}-

{{!}} Can I use {{project_name_gateway_long}} CLI in conjunction with {{project_name_workstation_long}} Xfce?
{{!}} [https://forums.whonix.org/t/can-i-combine-whonix-gateway-cli-with-whonix-workstation-xfce-yes/6308 Absolutely, find out more here.] However, {{project_name_short}} Windows Installer is only available for {{project_name_short}} Xfce. The {{project_name_short}} CLI can be acquired from the [[VirtualBox{{!}}{{project_name_short}} for VirtualBox]] page. 
{{!}}-

{{!}} Where can I find the main FAQ?
{{!}} Check out the [[FAQ{{!}}{{project_name_short}} FAQ]].
