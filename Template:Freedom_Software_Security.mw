[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software Open Source software] like [[Qubes]], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux Linux] and [https://www.whonix.org {{project_name_long}}] is more secure than [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software closed source] software. The public scrutiny of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_by_design security by design] has proven to be superior to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity security through obscurity]. This aligns the software development process with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle#Origins Kerckhoffs' principle] - the basis of modern [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher cipher]-systems design. This principle asserts that systems must be secure, even if the adversary knows everything about how they work. Generally speaking, Freedom Software projects are much more open and respectful of the privacy rights of users.
