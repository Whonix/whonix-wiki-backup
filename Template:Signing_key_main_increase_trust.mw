</noinclude>Configure the trust level for the GPG key. 

Optional. <ref name=gpg-import-ownertrust>
The trust level will be increased to <code>ultimately</code>. (This is because the command contains trust level "<code>:6:</code>".)
<br />
The purpose of this command is:

* '''A)''' to avoid the following warning when importing the key. And,

<pre>
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
</pre>

* '''B)''' to avoid the following warning when verifying a file signed by that key.

<pre>
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature! 
gpg: There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
</pre>

Advanced users are free to skip this step or use a different GPG trust level.

{{CodeSelect|code=
echo "916B8D99C38EAF5E8ADC7A2A8D66066A2EEACCDA:6:" {{!}} gpg --import-ownertrust
}}

The output should create trustdb.

<pre>
gpg: /home/user/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
gpg: inserting ownertrust of 6
