This application requires incoming connections through a [[Tor]] onion service. Supported [[{{project_name_gateway_short}}|{{project_name_gateway_long}}]] modifications are therefore necessary for full functionality; see the instructions below.

For better security, consider using [[Multiple Whonix-Gateway|Multiple {{project_name_gateway_short}}]] and [[Multiple Whonix-Workstation|Multiple {{project_name_workstation_long}}]]. In any case, [[About|{{project_name_short}}]] is the safest choice for running it. <ref>
<u>Security considerations:</u>

* By using {{project_name_short}}, additional protections are in place for enhanced security.
* This application requires access to Tor's control protocol.
* In the {{project_name_short}} context, Tor's control protocol has dangerous features. The Tor control command {{Code2|GETINFO address}} reveals the real, external IP of the Tor client.
* {{project_name_short}} provides [[Dev/onion-grater|onion-grater, a Tor Control Port Filter Proxy - filtering dangerous Tor Control Port commands]].
* When this application is run inside {{project_name_gateway_short}} with an onion-grater whitelist extension, it limits {{project_name_workstation_short}} application rights to Tor control protocol access only. Non-whitelisted Tor control commands such as {{Code2|GETINFO address}} are rejected by onion-grater in these circumstances. In this event, {{project_name_workstation_short}} cannot determine its own IP address via requests to the Tor Controller, as onion-grater filters the reply.
* In comparison with other operating systems:
** If the application is run on a non-Tor-focused operating system like Debian: The application will have unlimited access to Tor's control protocol (a less secure configuration).
** Whonix: The application's access to Tor's control protocol is limited. Only whitelisted Tor control protocol commands required by the application are allowed.
* Comparison of using Tor as a client versus hosting Tor onion services.
** Using Tor only as a client: More secure.
** When hosting Tor onion services: Users are more vulnerable to attacks against the Tor network. This is elaborated in chapter [[Onion_Services#Onion_Services_Security|Onion Services Security]].

In conclusion, {{project_name_short}} is the safest and correct choice for running this application.
