'''Introduction'''

Disabling stream isolation will prevent bypassing of the tunnel-link. By default, [[Stream_Isolation#List|many pre-installed applications]] are configured for [[Stream Isolation]] in {{project_name_long}}. These specific applications are configured to use Tor SocksPorts, instead of Tor's TransPort.

All applications which are configured to use a Tor <code>SocksPorts</code> are not tunneled through the tunnel-link, but instead they are <u>only</u> tunneled through Tor. The reason is the following configuration does not touch local connections to {{Code2|10.152.152.10}}, which is the {{project_name_gateway_long}}. Therefore, all [[Tor Browser]] proxy settings must be removed if attempting to tunnel Tor Browser via the route <code>User</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>Tunnel-link</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code> (or similar); see below for instructions.
