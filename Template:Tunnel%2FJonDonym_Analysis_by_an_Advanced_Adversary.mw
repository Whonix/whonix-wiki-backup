'''JonDoNym Analysis by an Advanced Adversary''' <ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20210617211029/https://search.edwardsnowden.com/docs/InternetAnonymity20112014-12-28nsadocs</ref>

<blockquote>
(S//REL) Open Source Multi-Hop Networks

(S//REL) Jondo Anonymous Proxy (JAP)

(S//REL) Championed by German University (Dresden)

(S//REL) (Mostly?) Open source software - some Docs in German
(S//REL) Uses a technology known as Cascades

* (S//REL) Each cascade is set of 2 or 3 Mixes

* (S//REL) All internal traffic encrypted

* (S//REL) Free service AN.ON: 5 Cascades

* (S//REL) Premium service JonDoNym: 10 Cascades

(S//REL) Countries: BG, CA, CH, CZ, DE, DK, FR, GB, IT, LU, US,
(S//REL) Less than 50 mixes total

(S//REL) Open Source Multi-Hop Networks

(S//REL) Jondo Anonymous Proxy (JAP)

(S//REL) Comparison with Tor

• (S//REL) Not nearly as well studied

* (S//REL) Much smaller contained development community

• (S//REL) More centralized structure (all mixes centrally approved)

• (S//REL) Not as diverse geographically or scalable

* (S//REL) Not as well used or publicized

(S//REL) Not analyzed in great detail here at NSA (or FVEY?)
(TS//SI//REL) Much better chance for Global Adversary (SIGINT :-))

* (TS//SI//REL) Sessionization of DNI still would be a problem
