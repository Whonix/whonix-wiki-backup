= Current Situation =
The [[Download]]able {{project_name_long}} versions are available with either:

* [[VirtualBox/XFCE|Xfce]] desktop environment; <u>OR</u>
* [[VirtualBox/CLI|CLI]] text terminal only (no desktop environment).

However, other desktop environments like GNOME, KDE, LXDE and so on can be manually installed.

= Risks =
When installing your own desktop environment such as GNOME, you're on your own. If you are going that path, start with {{project_name_long}} CLI, the text terminal only version of {{project_name_long}}, which comes without a desktop environment installed by default, and install a desktop environment of your choice there. This is much better than starting with {{project_name_long}} Xfce and then uninstalling Xfce to install another desktop environment.

Other desktop environments install other background services. The {{project_name_long}} project hasn't researched the security/privacy implications of having these installed. For example, GNOME automatically installs [https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/geoclue/geoclue/-/wikis/home GeoClue]. ([https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Systemcheck systemcheck] warns if that very package is installed, but still... Other desktop environments also ship a different selection of default applications that have not necessarily been checked for security/privacy. Installing your own desktop environment may result in installing software packages not well hardened or chosen based on security wise.

= Future =
Since {{project_name_long}} is an Open Source / [https://forums.whonix.org/t/lets-call-it-freedom-software-rather-than-free-software-or-open-source/6961 Freedom Software] project, {{project_name_long}} developers are hoping that other developers join the project and maintain other desktop environments. That someone could be you?
