How to use Other Desktop Environments other than Xfce with {{project_name_short}}. Current situation. Risks. Future. (Gnome, KDE, LXQt, MATE, ...)
}}
= Current Situation =
As of version <code>17</code>, the [[Download]]able {{project_name_short}} versions are available with either:

* '''A)''' <u>[[VirtualBox#GUI|Xfce]]:</u> desktop environment ({{gui}}; <u>OR</u>
* '''B)''' <u>[[VirtualBox#CLI|{{cli}}]]:</u> text terminal only (no desktop environment).

(Version <code>18</code> might be released with a different desktop environment.)

However, other desktop environments like Gnome, KDE, LXQt, LXDE and so on can be manually installed.

{{upstream_wiki}}

= Future =
Since {{project_name_short}} is an Open Source / [https://forums.whonix.org/t/lets-call-it-freedom-software-rather-than-free-software-or-open-source/6961 Freedom Software] project, {{project_name_short}} developers are hoping that other developers join the project and maintain other desktop environments. That someone could be you?
