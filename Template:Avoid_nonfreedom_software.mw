For system privacy, freedom and security it is strongly advised to not install [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software proprietary], [https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.html non-freedom] software. Instead, use of [https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software Free Software] is [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/shouldbefree.html recommended]. As Free Software pioneer [https://www.stallman.org/ Richard Stallman] puts it:

* "... If you run a nonfree program on your computer, it denies your freedom; the main one harmed is you. ..."
* "Every nonfree program has a lord, a master -- and if you use the program, he is your master.â€œ
* "To have the choice between proprietary software packages, is being able to choose your master. Freedom means not having a master. And in the area of computing, freedom means not using proprietary software."

Or as the [https://www.gnu.org/ GNU project] puts it <ref>
Changed "back door" to "backdoor".
</ref>:

* <blockquote>[https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.html Proprietary Software Is Often Malware]</blockquote>
* <blockquote>Nonfree (proprietary) software is very often malware (designed to mistreat the user). Nonfree software is controlled by its developers, which puts them in a position of power over the users; [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html that is the basic injustice]. The developers and manufacturers often exercise that power to the detriment of the users they ought to serve.</blockquote>
* <blockquote>This typically takes the form of malicious functionalities.</blockquote>
* <blockquote>Some malicious functionalities are mediated by backdoors.</blockquote>
* <blockquote>Backdoor: any feature of a program that enables someone who is not supposed to be in control of the computer where it is installed to send it commands. (Note by editor: "Most times without user awareness or consent.")</blockquote>

The GNU project created a [https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary-back-doors.html list with examples of Proprietary Backdoors]. The [https://www.eff.org/ Electronic Frontier Foundation] (EFF) has [https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/who-really-owns-your-drones other examples of the use of backdoors].

Possible risks associated with using non-freedom software:

* <u>Vendor lock-in and abandonware</u>: Your data is saved in obfuscated formats that depend on a closed software package. If the company goes out of business or they decide to change the format down the line, you are held hostage to these companies and need to pay up to access it. In contrast, FLOSS (<u>F</u>ree/<u>L</u>ibre and <u>O</u>pen <u>S</u>ource <u>S</u>oftware) uses open, documented file formats and popular abandoned software projects have a much higher chance of finding a new developer.
* <u>DRM</u>: Publishing companies treat their customers like thieves and severely limit what they can do with media they purchased.
* <u>Malware</u>: Potential advanced malware in the software itself that is not easily reversed or discovered.
* <u>Freedom Restrictions and Privacy Invasion:</u> No ability to change or disable undesirable privacy violating features like telemetry because of licensing restrictions and absence of source code. It is extremely rare that anti-features are added by FLOSS developers because it is antithetical to the community culture and easily remedied if discovered by others who can fork the software and fix it.
* <u>Privacy Breaches</u>: Proprietary software is notorious for harvesting user data and monetizing it with advertisement networks which themselves have been used as malware delivery networks by malicious customers.
* <u>Third Party Dependencies</u>: Software that depends on third party servers could access identifying information for payments or logins linked to real identity.
* <u>More defects per line</u>: While FLOSS software isn't automatically security bug free, it objectively has less defects per lines of code compared to proprietary software. <ref>https://www.techrepublic.com/article/open-source-vs-proprietary/</ref>

Even as a non-developer, a user's attention, suggestions and testing is a valuable public service and further strengthens the libre alternatives which will stay available to everyone indefinitely. It is in the user's interest to support FLOSS and decentralization to keep free computing alive and to curtail abusive monopolist practices and influence. Even if the FLOSS package's functionality is lacking in the short-term (this is very rare nowadays with FLOSS leaving proprietary in the dust), these can always be improved, but the drawbacks of proprietary software listed above are intrinsic to their mode of development and is not something that can change for the better.
