[[Qubes|{{q_project_name_long}}]] note: The {{Code2|IP of [[{{project_name_workstation_short}}|{{project_name_workstation_long}}]] AppVM}} needs to be replaced with the actual IP address. To find out the IP address of the {{q_project_name_long}} {{project_name_workstation_long}} AppVM, the following command can be run within the {{q_project_name_long}} {{project_name_workstation_long}} AppVM.

{{CodeSelect|code=
qubesdb-read /qubes-ip
}}

Do not use IP <code>10.152.152.11</code> because that only works with [[Qubes|{{non_q_project_name_short}}]] but not with [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_short}}]]. The IP <code>10.152.152.11</code> in line starting with <code>HiddenServicePort</code> needs to be replaced.
