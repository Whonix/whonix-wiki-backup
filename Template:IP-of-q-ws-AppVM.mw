[[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]] note: The {{Code2|IP of [[{{project_name_workstation_short}}|{{project_name_workstation_long}}]] AppVM}} needs to be replaced with the actual IP address. To find out the IP address of the {{q_project_name}} {{project_name_workstation_long}} AppVM, the following command can be run within the {{q_project_name}} {{project_name_workstation_long}} AppVM.

{{CodeSelect|code=

}}

Do not use IP <code>10.152.152.11</code> because that only works with [[{{non_q_project_name_short}}|{{non q project name}}]] but not with [[{{q_project_name_short}}|{{q_project_name}}]]. The IP <code>10.152.152.11</code> in line starting with <code>HiddenServicePort</code> needs to be replaced.
