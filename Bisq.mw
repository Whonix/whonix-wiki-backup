__FORCETOC__
= Introduction =

Bisq is an open-source, peer-to-peer (P2P) application that went into production on 19 April, 2016. Bisq is designed to allow for a safe, private and decentralized method of exchanging national currencies for cryptocurrencies. Primary features include: <ref>https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq</ref> <ref>https://bisq.network/</ref> <ref>https://docs.bisq.network/exchange/whitepaper.html#introduction</ref>
<div style="column-count:2;-moz-column-count:2;-webkit-column-count:2">
* no registration is required - identity theft is impossible
* fully decentralized and censorship resistant design:
** multi-signature escrow transactions without a third party
** security deposits encourage safe, successful trades <ref>A current limit of at most 1 Bitcoin per transaction applies.</ref>
** resolution of disputes with a decentralized arbitration system
* protection of user privacy via a custom P2P network of users running Bisq over Tor
* no data is stored regarding who trades with whom -- end-to-end data encryption ensures trade details are only readable by counterparties
* no approval wait times
* resistant against spam or flooding
* a cross-platform desktop application is available for Linux, macOS and Windows
* the project is funded directly by its users through trading fees and donations
</div>
Bisq holds a lot of promise, since it eliminates the risk associated with theft of funds from centralized exchanges, removes the threat of interference with trades from third parties, and separates users' personal information from associated transactions. To learn more, refer to:
* the [https://docs.bisq.network/exchange/whitepaper.html original Bisq whitepaper]; and/or

=== Tor over Tor Prevention ===
'''On {{project_name_workstation_short}}.'''

Follow these steps to avoid a Tor over Tor scenario.

Create folder <code>/home/user/.local/share/Bisq/btc_mainnet/tor/</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
mkdir -p /home/user/.local/share/Bisq/btc_mainnet/tor/
}}

Create a dummy Tor binary <code>/home/user/.local/share/Bisq/btc_mainnet/tor/tor</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo touch /home/user/.local/share/Bisq/btc_mainnet/tor/tor
}}

=== xdg-desktop-menu Bug Workaround ===
'''On {{project_name_workstation_short}}.'''

Use the following workaround to avoid a known bug in xdg which fails to find a writable system menu directory. <ref>
https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/848
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/desktop-directories
}}

=== Install ===

For '''{{q_project_name_long}}''' you need create binding dirs in VM:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mkdir -p /rw/bind-dirs/opt/bisq
sudo mkdir -p /rw/bind-dirs/usr/share/desktop-directories
sudo mkdir -p /rw/config/qubes-bind-dirs.d
}}

Then create the configuration file:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo nano /rw/config/qubes-bind-dirs.d/50_user.conf
}}

And specify which system folders are mapped to binding dirs â€” write there two lines and save:

{{CodeSelect|code=
binds+=( '/opt/bisq' )
binds+=( '/usr/share/desktop-directories' )
}}

Restart the qube to apply the binding dir settings.

'''On {{project_name_workstation_short}}.'''

Install Bisq.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo dpkg -i Bisq*.deb
}}

= Usage =
'''On {{project_name_workstation_short}}.'''

Start Bisq.

{{CodeSelect|code=
/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq --torControlPort=9051 --torControlPassword=notrequired --socks5ProxyBtcAddress=127.0.0.1:9050 --useTorForBtc=true
}}

After version 1.9.8, the use of DAO became mandatory for everyone and the line <code>--daoActivated=false</code> now gives an error.

If the fonts are too small, you could alternatively use the following command. <ref>
It is the same as above but prepended with <code>GDK_SCALE=2</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=

}}
