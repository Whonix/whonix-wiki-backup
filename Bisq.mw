__FORCETOC__
= Introduction =

Bisq is an open-source, peer-to-peer (P2P) application that went into production on 19 April, 2016. Bisq is designed to allow for a safe, private and decentralized method of exchanging national currencies for cryptocurrencies. Primary features include: <ref>https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq</ref> <ref>https://bisq.network/</ref> <ref>https://docs.bisq.network/exchange/whitepaper.html#introduction</ref>
<div style="column-count:2;-moz-column-count:2;-webkit-column-count:2">
* no registration is required - identity theft is impossible
* fully decentralized and censorship resistant design:
** multi-signature escrow transactions without a third party
** security deposits encourage safe, successful trades <ref>A current limit of at most 1 Bitcoin per transaction applies.</ref>
** resolution of disputes with a decentralized arbitration system
* protection of user privacy via a custom P2P network of users running Bisq over Tor
* no data is stored regarding who trades with whom -- end-to-end data encryption ensures trade details are only readable by counterparties
* no approval wait times
* resistant against spam or flooding
* a cross-platform desktop application is available for Linux, macOS and Windows
* the project is funded directly by its users through trading fees and donations
</div>
Bisq holds a lot of promise, since it eliminates the risk associated with theft of funds from centralized exchanges, removes the threat of interference with trades from third parties, and separates users' personal information from associated transactions. To learn more, refer to:
* the [https://docs.bisq.network/exchange/whitepaper.html original Bisq whitepaper]; and/or

== {{project_name_workstation_long}} Installation Steps ==

=== System Requirements ===

Bisq is an application that is very resource intensive. Your system needs to accommodate the program requirements by changing the VM configuration.

Platform specific.

* [[VirtualBox]] / [[KVM]]:
** {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=Tuning#Increase_Virtual_Machine_RAM
|text=Increase Virtual Machine RAM
}} to 6GB.
* [[Qubes-Whonix]]: Assuming that your {{project_name_workstation_long}} is named <code>anon-bisq</code>. <u>In dom0</u>, run:
** {{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-prefs anon-bisq memory 600
}}
** Memory: <code>6GB</code>: {{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-prefs anon-bisq maxmem 6000
}}
** Virtual CPU: <code>4</code>. {{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-prefs anon-bisq vcpus 4
}}
** Storage: <code>5GB</code>. {{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-volume extend anon-bisq:private 5Gi
}}

=== Firewall Settings ===
Modify the {{project_name_workstation_short}} (<code>{{project_name_workstation_vm}}</code>) user firewall settings and reload them.

{{Firewall_Settings_Workstation}}

Add. TODO: <code>EXTERNAL_OPEN_ALL=true</code> is non-ideal.

{{CodeSelect|code=
EXTERNAL_OPEN_ALL=true
}}

Save.

{{Reload_Firewall_ws}}

=== Tor over Tor Prevention ===
'''On {{project_name_workstation_short}}.'''

Follow these steps to avoid a Tor over Tor scenario.

* '''Bisq <u>1</u>:'''
** Create folder the Bisq tor folder. {{CodeSelect|code=
mkdir -p /home/user/.local/share/Bisq/btc_mainnet/tor/
}}
** Create a dummy tor binary. {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo touch /home/user/.local/share/Bisq/btc_mainnet/tor/tor
}}
** Add the executable bit to the dummy tor binary. {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo chmod +x /home/user/.local/share/Bisq/btc_mainnet/tor/tor
}}
** Why is this needed? Optional. See footnote for reasons why. Users can skip this step. <ref>
* Users: Ignore this footnote
* Developers: For an explanation which might be interesting for developers only, see below. 

Bisq installs its own version of Tor.

From Bisq 2 log.

<pre>
16:06:19.474 INFO  [NetworkService.network-IO-pool-0] b.t.i.TorInstaller: Tor files installed to /home/user/.local/share/Bisq2/tor 
</pre>

Why sudo? To avoid <code>/home/user/.local/share/Bisq2/tor/tor</code> getting overwritten by Bisq.

After version 1.9.8, the use of DAO became mandatory for everyone and the line <code>--daoActivated=false</code> now gives an error.

If the fonts are too small, you could alternatively use the following command. <ref>
It is the same as above but prepended with <code>GDK_SCALE=2</code>.
