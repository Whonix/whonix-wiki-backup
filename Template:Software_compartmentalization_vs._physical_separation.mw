[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna_Rutkowska Joanna Rutkowska], security researcher, founder and developer emeritus of [https://www.qubes-os.org/ Qubes OS] has completed a research paper comparing the security of [https://invisiblethingslab.com/resources/2014/Software_compartmentalization_vs_physical_separation.pdf software compartmentalization vs. physically separated computers] (pdf).
