System Requirements for {{project_name_long}}
}}
= Supported Host Operating Systems =
Any operating system that can run a supported virtualizer can run {{project_name_long}}, including Windows, macOS, BSD, and Linux. Most users get started by installing [[VirtualBox]] on their current operating system and importing the {{project_name_long}} images. Advanced users may wish to [[Host Operating System Selection|select]] and boot a host operating system (usually a Linux distribution) dedicated solely to running the {{project_name_long}} virtual machines.

For the best possible security, users can choose to run {{project_name_long}} virtual machines on the Qubes platform ({{q_project_name}}). Qubes is a Xen-based hypervisor (virtualizer) that runs on the bare metal of the hardware instead of within a host operating system. <ref>This is more secure because an attacker must subvert the hypervisor, which is far more difficult than exploiting a host operating system.</ref>

= {{non_q_project_name_short}} System Requirements =
{{Non_q_project_name}} includes {{project_name_long}} for [[VirtualBox]] and [[KVM]].

|
* {{project_name_workstation_long}} can be run with 256 MB RAM when not using a desktop environment. {{Minimum_RAM}}
* {{project_name_long}} 16 changed the display manager from <code>lightdm</code> to <code>gdm3</code>. 1 GB RAM is now required for Xfce desktop to launch. <ref>[https://forums.whonix.org/t/debian-kvm-whonix-16-flashing-underscore-on-black-screen/12436/12 Debian + KVM + Whonix 16 (Flashing underscore on black screen)].</ref> <ref>[https://forums.whonix.org/t/display-manager-lightdm-gdm3-sddm-or-no-display-manager-startx/12457 display manager - lightdm, gdm3].</ref>
* For low memory and console-only configurations, see
** [[RAM|Advice for Systems with Low RAM]],
** [[Troubleshooting#Low_RAM_Issues|Troubleshooting, Low RAM Issues]] and
** [[Desktop#RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter|Ram Adjusted Desktop Starter]].
* Users that experience the PAE or "{{Code2|VERR_SSM_FIELD_NOT_CONSECUTIVE}}" error or other problems should refer to the [[VirtualBox/Troubleshooting|VirtualBox Troubleshooting]] chapter.

= {{q_project_name}} System Requirements =

{{q_project_name}} does not have any special system requirements over and above Qubes own system requirements. In other words, it is only necessary to fulfill the minimal system requirements for Qubes compatibility.
