{{Project_License}}

== Wiki ==
For the following reasons, only the plain text is licensed:

* The design, html, CSS, and JavaScript (MediaWiki) aren’t copyrighted by {{project_name_short}}. These rely upon the license provided by MediaWiki / any wiki skins / extensions {{project_name_short}} is using. Anybody interested in using these elements is better off acquiring them from the origin/upstream and not from {{project_name_short}}, since {{project_name_short}} does not fork it. This description is purposefully generic in nature. The actual current license (version) of MediaWiki is deliberately unmentioned. This avoids inaccuracies and publications becoming outdated at a later time. The reader is recommended to seek this information from the original MediaWiki source.
* Illustrative images (See [https://forums.whonix.org/t/missing-libre-illustrative-images/3912 Missing Libre Illustrative Images] for examples) are not copyrighted by {{project_name_short}}.
* Some screenshots might be Freedom Software licensed by third parties but still not be copyrighted by {{project_name_short}} or under a {{project_name_short}} license.

The {{software-name}} wiki text is a compilation of documentation, each under its own license.<br />
The compilation is made available under the terms of the <code>{{license_name_wiki}}</code>, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version with additional terms applicable per AGNU GPL version 3 section 7.

The license can be referred to as <code>{{license_name_wiki}}</code>.<br />
For considerations - which however are not part of the license - why this license was chosen, see our wiki page [[Dev/Licensing]].

Individual pages utilizing different licenses mention these in the wiki source code. This can be viewed when using the edit function (Actions → Edit) and/or when downloading [[Offline_Documentation|{{project_name_short}} wiki source code]]. Additionally, this is mentioned in the chapter License for applicable wiki pages.
