'''1. Proxy Type'''

The proxy type is the protocol which is used to communicate with the proxy server. Since there are only three options, they can all be tried until one works.

'''2. Proxy IP/hostname'''

It is necessary to know the proxy IP for attempted connections. If the user is trying to connect to a local proxy, then 127.0.0.1 should be specified since it is the localhost.

'''3. Proxy Port number'''

It is necessary to know the port number for attempted connections. It should be a positive integer from 1 to 65535. If searching for the listening port number of a well-known censorship circumvention tool, it can be found online.

'''4. Username and Password'''
If the username and password are unknown, they should be left blank to see if the connection will succeed. In most cases they are not needed.
