SecBrowser™ has been deprecated and is now [[unsupported]]. You can explore the [https://mullvad.net/en/browser Mullvad Browser], which follows the same concept.

Deprecation reasons:

* Quote [[Dev/Kicksecure Default Browser|Kicksecure Default Browser development considerations]]:  <blockquote>SecBrowser (a browser providing better privacy when browsing clearnet) will not be installed by default in {{kicksecure}} because of grave usability issues, namely its window bar is still saying "Tor Browser" rather than Firefox or SecBrowser. That would be too confusing for new users of Kicksecure.</blockquote>
* The development effort is too high.
