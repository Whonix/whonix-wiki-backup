<noinclude>{{header}}</noinclude>Ubuntu Software Center can be used to install VirtualBox. The process is similar to installation of most other applications.

This only works for users with computers that do not have "SecureBoot" enabled. If the user's computer is using "SecureBoot" the user need to either disable "SecureBoot" in the BIOS or use the command line based instructions. <ref>
[[unspecific|This is unspecific to {{project_name_short}}.]] This is because during package installation of a package that requires kernel modules when "SecureBoot" is enabled, Ubuntu's <code>dkms</code> is prompting the user for a password to encrypt the key which will be used to enroll the kernel module signing key. This is Ubuntu usability issue. It is unknown if any bug report / feature request for this exists. Please contribute, research, report this issue on Ubuntu's issue tracker.
