= Advantages of {{project_name_short}} on USB =

{{mbox
|text=
{{Icon|style=circle|fa-solid fa-shield-halved cs-blue}} '''Better Security''': A higher level of security is achieved by installing the host operating system(s) on a dedicated, ([[Full Disk Encryption|encrypted]]), external disk(s) such as a USB flash drive or others. <ref>
e.g., eSATA or FireWire.

FireWire should generally be avoided:

* https://louwrentius.com/firewire-the-forgotten-security-risk.html
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1394#Security_issues
</ref> In the case of using Dual Boot, using physical external media reduces the risk of malware running on other operating system(s) infecting the host operating system.

{{Icon|style=circle|fa-solid fa-key cs-blue}} '''Can be unplugged and securely stored''': When {{project_name_short}} disk(s) are not in use, they can either be removed or hidden.
