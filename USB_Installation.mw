{{intro|
'''{{project_name_short}} can be used as a plug-and-play operating system on a USB data stick'''. This is particularly interesting for users looking for a portable '''persistent''' <u>or</u> '''live''' operating system.
}}
== Current Situation ==
[[File:logo-usb-500x500.png|45px|link=]] Yes, {{project_name_short}} can be used on a USB.

# [[Host Operating System Selection|Select a suitable host operating system]].
# Install it on USB.
# Install a [[Download|supported virtualizer]].
# Finally install {{project_name_short}}.

At this time, {{project_name_short}} does not provide a USB creator / image.

There are a number of online guides explaining how to [https://www.debian.org/CD/live/ install Linux on a USB]. These instructions can be followed to create a live {{project_name_short}} USB, with the exception that both a supported virtualizer and {{project_name_short}} must also be installed on the external media.

If it is actually booting into non-persistent live boot is what you're interested in, look into [[Live Mode]].

Specifically useful as a host operating system on USB is {{Archive_link

}} which comes with the <code>grub-live</code> software package installed by default, which makes it possible to boot the host operating system into [[Live Mode]].

== Advantages ==
A higher level of security is attained by installing the host operating system(s) required for {{project_name_short}} on a dedicated, ([[Full Disk Encryption|encrypted]]), external disk(s) like a USB flash drive, FireWire or eSATA device:

* Using external media reduces the risk of other operating system(s) infecting the {{project_name_short}} host operating system.
* When {{project_name_short}} disk(s) are not in use, they can either be removed or hidden.
* Optional [[Live Mode]].
