On the [[Stream Isolation]] page, there is a list of applications that are pre-configured to use [[Stream_Isolation#By_Settings|socks proxy settings]] via application configuration files. To disable this the {{project_name_long}} system default must be removed from the application's settings.

TODO: document and expand.

{{Box|text=
Remove proxy settings for APT repository files.

'''1.''' Platform specific notice:

* [[{{Non q project name short}}|{{Non q project name}}]]: No platform specific notice.
* [[{{q_project_name_short}}|{{q_project_name}}]]: In Template. (<code>{{project name workstation template}}</code>)

'''2.''' If you previously onionized any repositories, that has to be undone; see [[Onionizing Repositories]].

'''3.''' Remove any mention of <code>tor+</code> in file <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> (if it was previously configured; that file is empty by default in {{project_name_long}} / Kicksecure) or any file in folder <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d</code>.

'''4.''' {{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*
}}

'''5.''' Remove any mention of <code>tor+</code>.

'''6.''' Done.

The process of removing proxy settings from APT repository files is now complete.

{{Box|text=
Remove proxy settings for [[Tor_Browser#Tor_Browser_Downloader_by_{{project_name_long}}|Tor Browser Downloader by {{project_name_long}}]].

'''1.''' Platform specific notice:

* [[{{Non q project name short}}|{{Non q project name}}]]: No platform specific notice.
* [[{{q_project_name_short}}|{{q_project_name}}]]: In Template. (<code>{{project name workstation template}}</code>) <ref name=usr-local-etc-torbrowser-dot-d>
{{q_project_name}} users note: In App Qube (<code>{{project name workstation template}}</code>) could also use file <code>/usr/local/etc/torbrowser.d/50_user.conf</code> instead.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Create folder <code>/usr/local/etc/torbrowser.d</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/torbrowser.d
}}

'''2.''' {{Open with root rights|filename=
/usr/local/etc/torbrowser.d/50_user.conf
}}
}}
</ref>

'''2.''' {{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/torbrowser.d/50_user.conf
}}

'''3.''' Paste. <ref>
<code>TB_NO_TOR_CON_CHECK=1</code> needs to be set because there is no filtered Tor ControlPort access when {{project_name_long}} tunnel firewall is enabled, which would break tb-updater's Tor connectivity check.
</ref> <ref>
By tb-updater default, if unset, variable <code>CURL_PROXY</code> will be dynamically set to a Tor SocksPort on {{project_name_gateway_long}}. For example to <code>CURL_PROXY="--proxy socks5h://user:password@10.137.6.1:9115"</code>.
<br />
By utilizing a curl parameter we are using anyhow -- <code>CURL_PROXY="--fail"</code> -- the environment variable can be disabled even if it is technically still set. This will result in downloading via the system's default networking.
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
TB_NO_TOR_CON_CHECK=1
CURL_PROXY="--fail"
}}

'''4.''' Save and exit.

'''5.''' Done.

Proxy settings have been removed from Tor Browser Downloader by {{project_name_long}}.

For some applications, this is impossible:

* [[sdwdate]]
* [[OnionShare|OnionShare]]
* [[Chat#Ricochet_IM|Ricochet IM]]

These applications can only talk to Tor [[Onion Services]] directly and cannot be configured to use the system default. Therefore you can only deactivate sdwdate and/or not use applications like OnionShare and Ricochet IM.
