These are recommended since these are used by the developers of {{project name long}}. The developer's familiarity with these operating systems makes it easier to provide maintenance and support.

Users that have never used any Linux based operating system ever before, that are currently using Windows or macOS as their computer operating system, might find it difficult at first to migrate to a Linux based operating system. ({{Archive_link
|url=https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Linux_User_Experience_versus_Commercial_Operating_Systems

}})

That is why {{project name long}} and {{Kicksecure}} are available on other operating systems such as Windows and macOS through use of virtualization. A familiar environment without the necessity of complex host operating system changes gives users a chance to experiment with their first Linux based operating system. This opportunity to learn more might become one day a user who mainly uses Linux as their host operating system.

As long as no downloadable {{Kicksecure}} ISO is available, Linux beginners might find Debian easier to use than {{Kicksecure}}.

Existing Debian, Ubuntu or other Debian derivatives users with essential knowledge about its usage however might find {{Kicksecure}} easy to use.

A [https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software Free Software] OS that respects user freedom is the only practical choice when it comes to privacy and security.

Use Linux on the host and prefer in-repository software that is automatically gpg-signed and installed from the distributor's repositories by the package manager. This is far safer than downloading programs from the Internet like Windows adherents are required to do.

In the past, virtually any Linux distribution could be recommended in order to protect privacy, however Ubuntu's history of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(user_interface)#Dash data-mining] makes it an unsuitable choice. <ref>
https://web.archive.org/web/20170110080220/https://fixubuntu.com/
</ref> Ubuntu's February 2016 Privacy Policy allowed search terms entered into the dash to be sent to Ubuntu and selected third parties to "complement" search results, along with the IP address. Fortunately this text has now been removed in the [https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/dataprivacy latest iteration of the document].

For additional reasons to avoid Ubuntu or Ubuntu-derived distributions, expand this section.
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
Ubuntu's paltry contributions to the upstream Libre projects they heavily rely upon is a policy decision and not a coincidence. Canonical founder Mark Shuttleworth has stated: "It is absolutely true we have no interest in the core fundamentals of the Linux kernel, none whatsoever." <ref>
https://web.archive.org/web/20191219195949/https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2168086/canonical-linux-kernel
</ref>

Canonical only bothers to majorly contribute in any way when forking significant projects; for example, Wayland into Mir, GNOME into Unity <ref>
https://web.archive.org/web/20150912223445/https://ask.fedoraproject.org/en/question/25127/how-to-build-unity-in-fedora/
</ref>, and .deb packages incompatible with Debian because of zstd compression. <ref>
https://www.phoronix.com/news/Ubuntu-Zstd-Deb-Packages
</ref> This appears to be a consistent attempt to fragment the software stack to lock in users and put pressure on competing distributions and vendors. <ref>
https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/25376.html
</ref> <ref>
https://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Blogs/Off-the-Beat-Bruce-Byfield-s-Blog/Mir-vs.-Wayland-show-why-upstream-projects-matter
</ref>

The Ubuntu Contributor License Agreement gives them complete power over patents that cover contributed code. Essentially they are granted the right to re-license this code under any license of their choice, including a proprietary one.

Ubuntu also has a history of treating staff in a hostile fashion. For example, the Kubuntu spin project lead was unilaterally removed without warning and contrary to wishes of his team members. <ref>
https://kver.wordpress.com/2015/05/27/making-sense-of-the-kubuntucanonical-leadership-spat/
</ref> Canonical also pilfered donation funds originally meant for desktop spin projects (Kubuntu, Lubuntu and others). In Kubuntu's case, after funding was abruptly dropped, Blue Systems had to step in to save the popular project. <ref>
https://www.pcworld.com/article/424171/kubuntus-founder-resigns-accuses-canonical-of-defrauding-donors-and-violating-copyright.html
</ref> <ref>
https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/kubuntu-devel/2012-February/005782.html
</ref>

Canonical has also been applying an absurd intellectual property (IP) policy over packages in its repositories for years. This resulted in claims that Canonical owns the copyright over any binaries compiled by their servers. After the FSF stepped in and arranged a resolution over a period of two years, the policy was amended to state that Canonicalâ€™s IP policy cannot override packages with GPL licenses. However, this now means that any package with a permissive license is now copyrighted by Canonical. <ref>
https://www.fsf.org/news/canonical-updated-licensing-terms
</ref> <ref>
https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/37113.html
</ref>

Unfortunately, downstream forks based on Ubuntu cannot be relied upon either. For example, the popular Linux Mint distribution was threatened with being cut off from access to Ubuntu infrastructure unless they caved in to Canonical's binary licensing terms. <ref>
https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=152450
</ref> Since then, Linux Mint has developed a version based on Debian instead. Canonical's vague trademark and IP policy has become toxic for downstream distributions. Many have made the smart choice to re-base on Debian instead of Ubuntu over the years including Kali, {{project_name_long}} <ref> [[Dev/Operating_System#Switch_from_Ubuntu_to_Debian]]
</ref> and others. <ref>
https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/45939.html
</ref>

A final major concern is Canonical's friendly relationship with Microsoft. This should make all Linux users uncomfortable, given Microsoft's strategy of "Embrace, Extend, Extinguish" with respect to Free Software. <ref>

In a fashion similar to Windows platforms, Apple operating systems also pose many security and privacy threats.

In public talks, ex-Tor developer Jacob Appelbaum who had access to the Snowden files, hinted that Apple devices in particular were easy to infiltrate by the Intelligence Community.

= Recommendation =

Based on the preceding sections and analysis, it is strongly recommended to learn more about Linux and install a suitable distribution that safeguards rights to secure and private computing. Otherwise, significant effort is required to play "whack-a-mole" with Windows and [[Malware and Firmware Trojans|malware]], which routinely subjects users to surveillance, limits choice, purposefully undermines security, and harasses via advertisements, forced updates, remote removal of applications without consent, and so on.
