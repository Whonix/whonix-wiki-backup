* BTC &rarr; XMR: Selling Bitcoin (BTC) and buying Monero (XMR). Users act as takers by default, meaning the BTC transaction must be initiated first.
* XMR &rarr; BTC: Selling Monero (XMR) and buying Bitcoin (BTC). Selling XMR requires additional effort, as manual sales are not possible. Instead, users can only post an offer to sell XMR if they have set up a "maker" client.
