* Only got a backup of <code>.vdi</code> virtual machine hard disk files? Want to restore them? That's what this page is for.
* Want to create a backup of {{project_name_long}}? See [[Backup VMs|Backup {{project_name_long}} VMs]] instead.
* In case you want to use other operating systems behind {{project_name_gateway_long}}, other than the default {{project_name_workstation_long}}, then rather read the [[Other Operating Systems]] page.

The following instructions are useful, if you have a backup of {{project_name_short}} <code>.vdi</code> (or <code>.vdmk</code>) hard disk images but want to restore them. This could be the case if your VM settings file is damaged or missing for some reason or if you only made a backup of the <code>.vdi</code> files.

'''1.''' Install {{project_name_short}} normally.

The easiest is probably to download and import a new {{project_name_short}} as if getting started with {{project_name_short}} for the first time.

This is required to get the required {{project_name_short}} VM settings (which configure important things such as connecting {{project_name_workstation_short}} to {{project_name_gateway_short}}.

'''2.''' Power off the VM.

If not already.

'''3.''' Replace the virtual hard disk files.

Note: This step is [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]]

In the VirtualBox VMs folder <code>~/VirtualBox VMs</code>, replace the original <code>.vdi</code> with the version from your backup.

'''4.''' Done.
