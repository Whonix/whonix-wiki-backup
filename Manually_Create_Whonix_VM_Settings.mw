The following instructions are useful, if you have a backup of {{project_name_long}} <code>.vdi</code> (or <code>.vdmk</code>) hard disk images but want to restore them. This could be the case if your VM settings file is damaged or missing for some reason or if you only made a backup of the <code>.vdi</code> files.

'''1.''' Install {{project name long}} normally.

The easiest is probably to download and import a new {{project name long}} as if getting started with {{project name long}} for the first time.

This is required to get the required {{project name long}} VM settings (which configure important things such as connecting {{project name workstation long}} to {{project name gateway long}}.

'''2.''' Power off the VM.

If not already.

'''3.''' Replace the virtual hard disk files.

Note: This step is [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project name long}}]]

In the VirtualBox VMs folder <code>~/VirtualBox VMs</code>, replace the original <code>.vdi</code> with the version from your backup.

'''4.''' Done.
