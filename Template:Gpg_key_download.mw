'''Warning:'''

The following command using <code>gpg</code> with <code>--recv-keys</code> is not recommended for security reasons and is often non-functional. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/gpg-recv-keys-fails-no-longer-use-keyservers-for-anything/5607</ref> This is not a {{project_name_long}}-specific issue. The OpenPGP public key should be downloaded from the web instead; see also [[Secure Downloads]]. This procedure is currently [[Unsupported|undocumented]] and can be resolved as per the [[Support#Free_Support_Principle|Free Support Principle]]. Documentation contributions will be happily considered.
