Consistent use of the {{project_name_short}} onion service affords several benefits. It provides alternative end-to-end encryption that is independent of {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=SSL
|text=TLS
}} certificate authorities and the mainstream Domain Name System. Additionally, it reduces the load on Tor exit nodes.
}}

The onion domain of {{project_name_short}} is <code>{{project_onion}}</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
{{project_onion}}
}}

Or, in machine-readable format ([[API]]), here is a raw link that only shows the onion: {{ExtLink

|2=http://www.{{project_onion}}/w/index.php?title=Template:Project_onion&action=raw

}}

To use <code>.onion</code> services when browsing <code>{{project_clearnet}}</code>, follow the links below to the {{project_name_short}} homepage, forums, download, Debian repository, issue tracker, or the {{project_name_short}} Debian repository.

[https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/advanced/onion-location/ <code>Onion-Location</code>]: Tor Browser 9.5 and later features an opt-in option for using onion sites automatically for participating websites. The system administrator of individual websites can choose to configure this. <ref>

</ref> Direct connections to onion services are harder to track than the <code>Onion-Location</code> opt-in method, which requires making DNS requests and web server connections from an exit node before switching to the onion service. The <code>{{project_clearnet}}</code> is participating by setting the <code>Onion-Location</code> header.

= Issues =
If special precautions are not taken, some resources from the clearnet <code>{{project_clearnet}}</code> address might be utilized when navigating the onion address. <ref>
The reason is that MediaWiki and Discourse are using the primary {{project_name_short}} HTTPS domain. These web applications do not support multiple domains for the same website. See also {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=Trust#Web_Application_Shortcomings
|text=Web Application Shortcomings
}} and {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=Privacy Policy Technical Details#Privacy_on_the_Website
|text=Privacy on the {{project_name_short}} Website
}}.

Also, note that on a few occasions in the past, it was not possible to log in to the {{project_name_short}} forums using the onion address. <ref>
https://forums.whonix.org/t/onion-forum-site-redirects-to-clearnet/197
</ref> <ref>
This suggests the {{project_name_short}} forums' onion address could become (temporarily) inaccessible in the future.

= Forcing onion =
There is currently no known method. This remains [[undocumented]].

* A) One way might be to configure the browser to block DNS requests to <code>{{project_clearnet}}</code>. However, this is browser-specific.
* B) Another way might be to configure the operating system to block DNS requests to <code>{{project_clearnet}}</code>. For example, on Linux-based operating systems, this can be done using the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file. However, this method is both operating system-dependent and browser-dependent, as some browser such as Firefox in the USA, which uses DNS over HTTPS (DoH), or Tor Browser using Tor, do not ask the operating system to resolve DNS.
