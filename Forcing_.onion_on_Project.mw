</ref> Direct connects to onion services are harder to track than the <code>Onion-Location</code> opt-in method, which must make DNS requests and web server connections from an exit node before being able to switch to the onion service. The <code>{{project_clearnet}}</code> is participating, setting the <code>Onion-Location</code> header.

There is currently no known method. This remains [[undocumented]].

* A) One way might be to configure the browser to block DNS requests to <code>{{project_clearnet}}</code>. But this is browser specific.
* B) Another way might be to configure the operating system to block DNS requests to <code>{{project_clearnet}}</code>. For example on Linux based operating systems using the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file. But this is operating system dependent as well as browser dependent because some browsers such as Firefox in USA use DNS over HTTPS (DoH) or Tor Browser using Tor which results in the browser not asking the operating system to resovle the DNS.

It not using special precautions: Some resources from the clearnet <code>{{project_clearnet}}</code> address might be utilized when navigating the onion address. <ref>
The reason is MediaWiki and discourse are using the primary {{project_name_long}} https domain. These webapps do not support multiple domains for the same website. See also [[Trust#Web_Application_Shortcomings|Web Application Shortcomings]] and [[Privacy Policy Technical Details#Privacy on the Website|Privacy on the  {{project_name_long}} Website]].
</ref> Also note that on a few occasions in the past it was not possible to log in to the {{project_name_long}} forums using the onion address. <ref>

This suggests the {{project_name_long}} forums onion address could become (temporarily) inaccessible in the future.
