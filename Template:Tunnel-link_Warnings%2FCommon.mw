| text    = Tor blocks by destination servers can usually be bypassed using simple [[Tor_Browser#Bypass_Tor_Censorship|proxies]], rather than adding an additional tunnel to Tor.

In order to circumvent state-level censorship of the Tor network, [[Bridges]] or other [[Lantern|alternative]] [[Anon_Connection_Wizard|circumvention]] [[Censorship_Circumvention_Tools|tools]] will probably be required. <ref>Users in China are [https://web.archive.org/web/20171218203107/https://www.cs.uml.edu/~xinwenfu/paper/Bridge.pdf unlikely to circumvent government censorship] with vanilla bridges, as they are uniformly blocked. That said, anon-connection-wizard configured with the meek-amazon or meek-azure pluggable transport is reported to bypass Chinese censorship in late 2017.</ref>

=== Trusting Service Providers ===

 A tunnel service provider that knows your identity and/or location may be more willing and able to compromise your privacy than your ISP.

=== Failed Closed Configurations ===
{{mbox

| text    =
If your software configuration doesnâ€™t block all traffic when your tunnel-link connection suddenly disconnects, your encrypted Tor traffic will go through your ISP without warning. This is the default nature of most tunnel configurations and not an issue specific to {{project_name_short}}. <ref>For example, VPNs require a failed closed configuration to prevent DNS leaks.</ref>

=== Tunnel-links can Affect Anonymity ===

| text    =
Using any extra tunnel, for example a VPN, proxy or SSH can can negatively affect anonymity under some circumstances. <ref>

To explain why that is, some background information is required so you can draw conclusions and take actions to avoid this risk. See below.

=== Using the same Tunnel Provider in  Multiple VMs at the same Time ===
{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px|alt=Warning]]
| text    =
Don't use the same tunnel provider / configuration in more than one place at the same time.<br />
<br />
For example, do not use the same tunnel setup inside {{project_name_gateway_long}} as well as inside {{project_name_workstation_long}}. Also do not use the same tunnel setup on the host and inside a {{project_name_gateway_long}} or {{project_name_workstation_long}} at the same time.

=== Reusing Tunnel-links ===
{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px|alt=Warning]]
| text    =
Individual tunnel-links should only be used for a single configuration and never reused in any other tunnel-link chains. Doing so could tie any anonymous identities associated with the tunnel-link to the user's ISP assigned IP address.


Example:

In tunnel-chain 1, the ISP assigned IP address is permanently linked to the tunnel-link. In tunnel-chain 2, the same tunnel-link was reused. Since the users ISP assigned IP address was previously linked to that same tunnel-link, that anonymous identity can now be linked to the user actual IP address.

* Tunnel-chain 1: (<code>User</code> &rarr; <code>Tunnel-link</code>[users IP address is linked] &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code>)

* Tunnel-chain 2: (<code>User</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>Tunnel-link</code>[anonymous activities linked] &rarr; <code>Internet</code>)

The previous example also holds true if the tunnel-link is first used with tunnel-chain 2 and then reused in tunnel-chain 1. If this were done, all anonymous activities conducted with tunnel-chain 2 would then be link with the users ISP assigned IP address.

=== {{q_project_name_long}} Templates ===

You probably do not want to run the tunnel software from within a Template. This is because the <code>\{\{project_name_gateway_template\}\}</code> Template "is more like a workstation". It is behind <code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code>. It is not <code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code> itself.<br />
<br />
(If you are using <code>openvpn</code> inside {{project_name_gateway_short}} (commonly called <code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code>) or {{project_name_workstation_short}} (commonly called <code>{{project_name_workstation_vm}}</code>) while following {{project_name_short}} documentation, <code>openvpn</code> will not start inside the <code>\{\{project_name_gateway_template\}\}</code> or <code>{{project_name_workstation_template}}</code> Template.) <ref>
This is because file [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/usability-misc/blob/master/usr/lib/systemd/system/openvpn%40openvpn.service.d/50_unpriv.conf /lib/systemd/system/openvpn@openvpn.service.d/50_unpriv.conf] checks the following condition
<pre>
ConditionPathExists=!/var/run/qubes-service/whonix-template
</pre>
Which means, if file <code>/var/run/qubes-service/whonix-template</code> exists, which is the case in {{project_name_short}} templateVMs, the {{Code2|openvpn@openvpn}} service will not be started.
</ref>
<br />
In Qubes R4 and above, the [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1858 Templates's NetVM is purposely set to <code>none</code> by Qubes default]. (They are upgraded through the qrexec based updates proxy that will be running on <code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code>.)
