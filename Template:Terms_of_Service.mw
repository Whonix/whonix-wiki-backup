The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

We need to reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute user contributions as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.

A Work made available to us may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:

* the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
* moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
* publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
* rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
* rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
* database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
* other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, you hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waive, abandon, and surrender all of your Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work:

* (i) in all territories worldwide,
* (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions),
* (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and
* (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes

to us. You acknowledge and agree that all your contributions will be the sole and exclusive property of {{name-short}} and you hereby irrevocably assign to {{name-short}} and agree to irrevocably assign to {{name-short}}, free and clear of any restrictions or encumbrances, all of your right, title, and interest in and to all your contributions, including without limitation all worldwide patent rights, copyright rights, trade secret rights, and other proprietary or intellectual property rights therein. This assignment includes, without limitation, all worldwide copyrights in and to the contribution, and the right to sue for past and future infringement. At {{name-short}}'s request and expense, you will execute documents and take such further acts as {{name-short}} may reasonably request to assist {{name-short}} to acquire, perfect, and maintain its intellectual property rights and other legal protections for the contributions.

You contribute for the benefit of {{name-short}} and to the detriment of your heirs and successors, fully intending that your copyright assignment to us shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by your express Statement of Purpose.
}}

=== License Fallback ===
{{Privacypolicy/Left|content=
If law doesn't permit you to transfer your copyright to us, you grant us a very broad license on your content.
}}

{{Privacypolicy/Right|content=
Should any part of the [[#Copyright Transfer Agreement|Copyright Transfer Agreement]] to {{name-short}} for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Copyright Transfer Agreement shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account your express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Copyright Transfer Agreement is so judged, you hereby grant to {{name-short}} a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise your Copyright and Related Rights in the Work:

* (i) in all territories worldwide,
* (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions),
* (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and
* (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display, distribute, remix, use commercially, use in advertising, promotional, and sell your contribution (the "License").

The License shall be deemed effective as of the date your contribution was submitted to us.

Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case you hereby affirm that you will not:

* (i) exercise any of your remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or
* (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to your express Statement of Purpose.

You irrevocably waive and agree never to assert such rights against us, any of our successors in interest, or any of our licensees, either direct or indirect.

For patent claims including, without limitation, method, process, and apparatus claims which you or your affiliates own, control, or have the right to grant, now or in the future, you grant to us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license, with the right to sublicense these rights to multiple tiers of sublicensees, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise transfer the contribution and the contribution in combination with the material (and portions of such combination). This license is granted only to the extent that the exercise of the licensed rights infringes such patent claims.

"Moral Rights" mean any rights to claim authorship of an invention, to object to or prevent the modification of any invention, or to withdraw from circulation or control the publication or distribution of any invention, and any similar right, existing under judicial or statutory law of any country in the world, or under any treaty, regardless of whether or not such right is denominated or generally referred to as a "moral right."
