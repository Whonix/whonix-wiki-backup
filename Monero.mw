= Stream Isolation =
Simplified: Stream isolation is about details. Not about IP masking. Your real external IP address is masked no matter what you do in the Whonix-Workstation. See also [[Reliable IP Hiding]].

[[Untested]]! [[Stream Isolation]] for Monero has not yet been considered. Refer to the [[Stream Isolation]] page and search for:

* {{CodeSelect|inline=true|code=torsocks}}, and
* {{CodeSelect|inline=true|code=IsolatePID 1}}.

To enforce stream isolation, you could experiment with the following commands.

<u>Note:</u> Replace <code>monerod</code>, <code>monero-wallet-gui</code>, <code>monero-wallet-cli</code> with the actual path to <code>monerod</code>, for example <code>/home/user/monero-gui/monerod</code> or <code>./monerod</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
DNS_PUBLIC=tcp TORSOCKS_ALLOW_INBOUND=1 torsocks monerod --p2p-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 --no-igd --hide-my-port
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
torsocks monero-wallet-gui
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
torsocks monero-wallet-cli
}}
