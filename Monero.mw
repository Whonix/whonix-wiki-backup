[[Stream Isolation]] for Monero has not yet been considered. Refer to the [[Stream Isolation]] page and search for <code>torsocks</code> <code>IsolatePID 1</code>.

To enforce stream isolation, you could experiment with the following commands.

When using Monero from monero-gui package you can use the following command below as is. Otherwise replace <code>monerod</code>, <code>monero-wallet-gui</code>, <code>monero-wallet-cli</code> with the actual path to monerod, for example <code>/home/user/monero-gui/monerod</code> or <code>./monerod</code>.
