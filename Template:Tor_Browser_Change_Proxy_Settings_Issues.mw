<u>Note</u>: This action will break both [[Stream Isolation]] for Tor Browser and [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/3455 Tor Browser's tab isolation by socks user name]. This worsens the [[Fingerprint#web_fingerprint|web fingerprint]] and leads to [[Tips_on_Remaining_Anonymous#Study:_Anonymity_and_Pseudonymity_are_not_the_same|pseudonymous (not anonymous) connections]]. To mitigate these risks, consider using [[Whonix-Workstation_Security_Hardening#Multiple_Tor_Browser_Instances|More than one Tor Browser in {{project_name_long}}]], or preferably [[Multiple Whonix-Workstation|Multiple {{project_name_workstation_long}}]].
