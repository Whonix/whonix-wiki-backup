{{project_name_short}} is not an investigative nor a malware forensics outfit. Leaks will be rejected. Unsolicited information will remain unread and will be securely deleted. No malware analysis and/or publication services are available. Feel free to consult third parties and knowledgeable malware researchers to discover the vulnerabilities, while notifying the publishers/maintainers of each package directly through responsible disclosure. Only [[#For Reporting Security Issues|responsibly notify us about security bugs in the instance of a {{project_name_short}} package]] being affected. <ref>
{{project_name_short}} is a very complex project with many aspects such as technology, legal, licenses, trademarks. Additional challenges from being a leak, investigative project or similar activities which would require very different infrastructure are therefore avoided.
