= {{project_name_long}} User Count Statistic =
{{metrics}}

The user count is manually updated on occasion, but it is a low priority.

The <code><u>daily</u> {{project_name_gateway_short}} users</code> estimate is impacted by several factors:

* <u>Total number of {{project_name_long}} users</u>: The <u>total</u> {{project_name_long}} user population is probably higher than the number of <u>daily</u> {{project_name_gateway_short}} users.
* <u>New day, still running, new count</u>: A {{project_name_gateway_short}} that runs longer than one day (24 hours) will re-fetch the {{project_name_long}} warrant canary and therefore be counted again.
* <u>New day, new boot, new count</u>: A {{project_name_gateway_short}} that has not been run for more than one day (24 hours) will re-fetch the {{project_name_long}} warrant canary and therefore be counted again.
* <u>Duplication</u>: Users relying upon multiple {{project_name_gateway_short}} are counted multiple times; this is difficult to avoid with the current design (see next section).
* <u>Non-duplication</u>: Boots are not explicitly counted. Users counts that rely upon the number of {{project_name_gateway_short}} boots would lead to overestimates because many users start and shutdown their computers several times a day.
* <u>Non-Live</u>: Live users are not counted.

= {{project_name_long}} User Count Design =
There are strict requirements for the {{project_name_long}} user count:

* no transfer of private information
* no unique identifiers are utilized
* no collection of IP addresses <ref>
By using an onion service, the server has no way to log originating IP addresses.

The <code>{{project_clearnet}}</code> website privacy policy is different, see:
* [[Privacy_Policy#IP_Addresses_and_IP_Addresses_Logging_Policy|IP Addresses and IP Addresses Logging Policy]]
* [[Trust#Trusting the {{project_name_long}} Website|Trusting the {{project_name_long}} Website]]
</ref>
* count only once within a 24 hour period
* provide an option to [[#Disable {{project_name_long}} User Count|disable user counts]]
* a by-product of, and based on [https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Systemcheck systemcheck]'s automated [[systemcheck#Warrant Canary Check|Warrant Canary Check]] <ref>
Which verifies the [[Trust#{{project_name_short}}_.E2.84.A2_Warrant_Canary|{{project_name_long}} warrant canary]].

* downloaded over Tor using the {{project_name_long}} v3 onion service <ref>This is similar to how [[sdwdate]] fetches time from onion time sources.</ref>
* secure operation <ref>This process has identical security to the [[systemcheck#Warrant Canary Check|Warrant Canary Check]].</ref>

= {{project_name_long}} User Count Rationale =

A user count statistic provides several benefits:

* {{project_name_long}} maintainers can track if the user population is increasing over time.
* Certain people or organizations decide whether to [[contribute]] based on the estimated impact of the {{project_name_long}} project.
* Statistics can help answer certain questions such as the estimated user population of different anonymity platforms.
* Direct comparisons between the number of Tor, Tails and {{project_name_long}} users become possible.
* Users can make an informed decision about [[Fingerprint|fingerprinting]] risks. <ref>Like whether they prefer sharing the same network fingerprint as thousands of other users ({{project_name_long}}) versus millions of other users (Tor Browser in isolation).</ref>
* User counts can inform broader Internet and network [[fingerprint|fingerprinting]] considerations.
* The data is already available due to [https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Systemcheck systemcheck]'s automated verification of the [[Trust#{{project_name_short}}_.E2.84.A2_Warrant_Canary|{{project_name_long}} warrant canary]]. <ref>
