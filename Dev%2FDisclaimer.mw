Written by Patrick Schleizer.

It has a legal background. Total exclusion of liability is not possible under German law. The idea was "make sure that someone who tries to misunderstand has no chance to misunderstand".

Due to technological improvements, there are now a lot fewer workplaces. This is awesome. But due to social, economic, and political dislocations, people do not work fewer hours, but instead come up with useless income-only places that do not produce real products. Since this is not widely understood yet, I think big industries that only waste a lot of paper emerged, including a wide variety of lawyers who make their living by suing people for things no one, not even themselves, really cares about. I think in Germany we are quite "advanced" in this field. Maybe US patent justice is "superior".

The text is tailored to my understanding of German law after extensive research. It is so clear and so much in their face, that I should be under the laws that apply to implied (non-written) contracts of absolute gifts.
