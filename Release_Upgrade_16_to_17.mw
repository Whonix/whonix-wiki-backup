! scope="row"| Difficulty
|
* Downloading a new {{project_name_gateway_long}} / {{project_name_workstation_long}} ([[Factory Reset]]) is easier than applying the [[Release Upgrade|Release Upgrade]] instructions on this page.
* Debian release notes:
** [https://www.debian.org/releases/bookworm/amd64/release-notes/ch-upgrading.en.html Chapter 4. Upgrades from Debian 11 (bullseye)]

! scope="row"| Release Upgrade vs Re-Installation
|
To use [[About|{{project_name_long}}]] 17, users can either:

* '''A)''' Release upgrade existing {{project_name_long}} 16 images using the instructions on this page; <u>OR</u>
* '''B)''' Factory Reset using the {{project_name_long}} re-install method by downloading the new release, which is much simpler than upgrading:
** [[{{non_q_project_name_short}}|{{non_q_project_name}}]] 17: [[Download|download the new release]].
** [[{{q_project_name_short}}|{{q_project_name}}]] 17: [[Qubes/Install|download the new release]].

! scope="row"| Standard Updates
|
* For standard ("everyday") update instructions see [[Operating System Software and Updates]]. <br />
* The instructions on this page describe how to perform a [[Release Upgrade]] from {{project_name_long}} 16 to {{project_name_long}} 17.
|-

! scope="row"| Automated Release Upgrade vs Manual Release Upgrade
|
* [[#Release Upgrade|Automated Release Upgrade]] is the newer method that has been implemented. It does not ask for user input and is therefore easier to use.
* The former Manual Release Upgrade effectively did the same, but it offered more control over system customization. It is now [[Deprecated#Manual Release Upgrade|deprecated]]. <ref>
This method is still possible. All the automated [https://github.com/Kicksecure/legacy-dist/blob/master/usr/sbin/release-upgrade <code>release-upgrade</code>] script does is perform actions which the user could perform manually. If a manual release upgrade is desired, emulate what the <code>release-upgrade</code> script is doing. The manual release upgrading procedure is [[Unsupported|undocumented]] due to the size of the instructions and duplication involved.

|-

! scope="row"| Configuration Files Resets
| Since this is an automated release upgrade, user modified configuration files (if any) in folder <code>/etc</code> will be reset, overwritten with the Debian or {{project_name_long}} package version. The user is free to restore the configuration after the release upgrade.
