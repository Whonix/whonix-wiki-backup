== Basic Tests ==
{{Box|text=
# Power off {{project_name_gateway_short}}. Try to ping outside or to use the browser in {{project_name_workstation_short}}. Obviously this should <u>not</u> work.
# Power on {{project_name_gateway_short}} again. Visit https://check.torproject.org/ with Tor Browser. You should see a “Congratulations”.
# Ping the {{project_name_gateway_short}}; this will <u>not</u> work. <ref>
You will not be able to ping the {{project_name_gateway_short}} because ICMP is blocked by the firewall. If you want to test it, you have to adjust the firewall or deactivate it while testing on both, {{project_name_gateway_short}} and {{project_name_workstation_short}}.
</ref> {{CodeSelect|code=
ping 10.152.152.10
}}
# Note: Ping commands should NOT work for external addresses from your {{project_name_workstation_short}}; ICMP traffic <ref>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol
</ref> is not proxied, and filtered by {{project_name_short}} Firewall ({{W_Firewall}}) because [[Tor#UDP|Tor does not support UDP]]. For more information on ping inside {{project_name_workstation_short}}, see [[Whonix-Workstation_Firewall#Ping|Whonix-Workstation Firewall, ping]].
# Use Tor Browser to visit an onion address - try the [http://{{torproject_web_onion}} torproject.org onion service].

}}
== Leak Tests ==
See [[Dev/Leak Tests]].

= {{project_name_workstation_short}} and {{project_name_gateway_short}} =

== Miscellaneous ==

locale
}}

2. Check apt config and see if periodic updates are disabled.

{{CodeSelect|code=
apt-config dump

}}
== Extra Tests ==
{{Box|text=
1. Check if aptitude is functional.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo aptitude update
}}

See the footnotes if additional manual tests are preferred. <ref>
These checks are not as important because relevant messages would probably be shown during <code>sudo systemctl list-units --failed</code>.

Check if ''/var/run/bootclockrandomization/success'' exists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ls -la /var/run/bootclockrandomization/success
}}

}}

Confirm the time sanity check status.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl status timesanitycheck.service
