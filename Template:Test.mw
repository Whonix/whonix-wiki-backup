{{project_name_long}} requires a critical mass of users to properly test planned updates by enabling the [[Project-APT-Repository#{{project_name_long}}_APT_Repository_Overview|stable-proposed-updates]] or [[Project-APT-Repository#{{project_name_long}}_APT_Repository_Overview|testers]] repository. <ref>
The developers repository is only recommended for experts or those in touch with {{project_name_long}} developers.
</ref> Otherwise, bugs might go undiscovered and be inadvertently introduced into the stable repository.

To ensure a stable {{project_name_long}} system is available at all times, willing testers should:

* Create new {{project_name_workstation_long}} and {{project_name_gateway_long}} Templates solely for testing.
* Enable the <code>stable-proposed-updates</code> or <code>testers</code> repository via the [[Project-APT-Repository#Change_{{project_name_long}}_APT_Repository|Derivative Repository Tool]].
* Platform-specific advice:
** [[Qubes|{{non_q_project_name_short}}]]: Create a [[{{project_name_workstation_short}}_Security#VM_Snapshots|clean snapshot]] or use [[Multiple Whonix-Workstation|Multiple {{project_name_workstation_long}}]] / [[Multiple Whonix-Gateway|Multiple {{project_name_gateway_long}}]].
** [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_long}}]]: Use [[Multiple Qubes-Whonix Templates|Multiple Templates]] and separate <code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}-test</code> and <code>{{project_name_workstation_vm}}-test</code> TemplateBasedVMs.

Then perform normal user activities.

Please only report bugs ''after'' first searching relevant {{project_name_long}} forums and developer portals for the problem. ([[Please_Use_Search_Engines_And_See_Documentation_First|Please use Search Engines and see Documentation First]])
