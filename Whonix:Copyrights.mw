{{Project_License}}

== Wiki ==
For the following reasons, only the plain text is licensed:

* The design, html, CSS, and JavaScript (mediawiki) aren’t copyrighted by {{project_name_long}}. These rely upon the license provided by mediawiki / any wiki skins / extensions {{project_name_long}} is using. Anybody interested in using these elements is better off acquiring it from the origin/upstream and not from {{project_name_long}}, since {{project_name_long}} does not fork it. This description is purposefully generic in nature. The actual current license (version) of mediawiki is deliberately unmentioned. This avoids inaccuracies and publications becoming outdated at a later time. The reader is recommended to seek this information from the original mediawiki source.
* Illustrative images (See [https://forums.whonix.org/t/missing-libre-illustrative-images/3912 Missing Libre Illustrative Images] for examples) are not copyrighted by {{project_name_long}}.
* Some screenshots might be Freedom Software licensed by third parties but still not be copyrighted by {{project_name_long}} or under a {{project_name_long}} license.

The {{software-name}} wiki text is a compilation of documentation, each under its own license.<br />
The compilation is made available the terms of the <code>{{license_name_wiki}}</code>, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version with additional terms applicable per AGNU GPL version 3 section 7.

The license can be refereed to as <code>{{license_name_wiki}}</code>.<br />
