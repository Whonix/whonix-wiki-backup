== Private Communications Policy ==
Please avoid private communications whenever possible. {{project_name_short}} is a [https://forums.whonix.org/t/lets-call-it-freedom-software-rather-than-free-software-or-open-source/6961 Freedom Software] project. Free as in Price as well as in Freedom. ([[Reasons for Freedom Software|Why?]]) Therefore as many communications as possible should happen in public for transparency. Post in [https://forums.{{project_clearnet}} {{project_name_short}} forums] whenever appropriate and possible.

== Encrypted Communications Policy ==
Encrypted communications are accepted in the following categories: <!--[[Investors]], [[Premium Support]], -->[[#For Reporting Security Issues|for reporting security issues]], [[#For Private Inquiries|for private inquiries]], legal.

== No Leaks Policy ==
{{project_name_short}} is not an investigative nor a malware forensics outfit. Leaks will be rejected. Unsolicited information will remain unread and will be securely deleted. No malware analysis and/or publication services are available. Feel free to consult third parties and knowledgeable malware researchers to discover the vulnerabilities, while notifying the publishers/maintainers of each package directly through responsible disclosure. Only [[#For Reporting Security Issues|responsibly notify us about security bugs in the instance of a {{project_name_short}} package]] being affected. <ref>
{{project_name_short}} is a very complex project with many aspects such as technology, legal, licenses, trademarks. Additional challenges from being a leak, investigative project or similar activities which would require very different infrastructure are therefore avoided.

== Social Media ==

There are a few [[Official Online Profiles|{{project_name_short}} Social Media Profiles]], but they should not be relied upon for the latest {{project_name_short}} news. See [[Stay Tuned]] for reliable ways of following {{project_name_short}} news.

In addition, when appropriate {{project_name_short}} developers should be directly contacted by email and not via social media as these are likely to get unnoticed.

Some users may wish to follow or like the available {{project_name_short}} profiles (with an anonymous account). This applies if it is safe to talk about using the {{project_name_short}} platform and you want to share your experience with others. This is also a small way to [[Contribute|contribute]] to the project.
