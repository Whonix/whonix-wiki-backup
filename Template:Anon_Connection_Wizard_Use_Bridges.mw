'''Option 2''': If none of the default bridges work, the user can try to obtain a set of bridges manually. See [[Bridges#Finding a Bridge and Choosing the Right Protocol|Finding a Bridge and Choosing the Right Protocol]]. After obtaining a set of Tor bridges, complete the following step.

<code>Select "Configure" in the beginning page</code> &rarr; <code>Select "I need Tor bridges to bypass the Tor censorship"</code> &rarr; <code>Select "Enter custom bridges"</code> &rarr; <code>Copy and paste the set of bridges to that input box(one bridge per line)</code>
