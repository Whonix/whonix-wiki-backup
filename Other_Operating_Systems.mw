{{intro|
Anonymize any operating system such as Debian, Ubuntu, Microsoft Windows or others.

{{project_name_gateway_long}} supports torification of any operating system, such Debian, Kicksecure, Ubuntu, Android or even Microsoft Windows and others by setting up a {{project_name_customworkstation_short}}.

A {{project_name_customworkstation_short}} is a VM that does not run the recommended, "normal" Whonix-"Default"-Workstation but instead runs a custom operating system such as Debian, Kicksecure, Ubuntu, Android or even Microsoft Windows.

= Custom-Workstation Security Introduction =
{{Community_Support}}

'''''Using a default workstation is easier and provides more Security out of the box!''''' It is the user's responsibility to get the same security features for a {{project_name_customworkstation_short}}, see [[Other_Operating_Systems#Security_Comparison:_{{project_name_long}}-Download-Workstation_vs._{{project_name_customworkstation_short}}|Security Comparison: {{project_name_long}}-Download-Workstation vs. {{project_name_customworkstation_short}}]] at the bottom of the page for details.

Also note that it's strongly discouraged to anonymize VMs that have ever been connected to the clearnet, meaning without Tor. It is conceivable that the custom operating system creates unique identifiers or another unique fingerprint such as network or browser fingerprint. Such fingerprints can lead to de-anonymization even if a VM that was used over clearnet at least once is later used over Tor. In other words, it is highly recommended to configure custom operating systems to use {{project_name_gateway_short}} to ensure that Tor is always consistently used.

== Introduction ==
Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10 are known to work behind {{project_name_gateway_short}}. While it is possible, it is not recommended and only for advanced users. This is because, there are issues with Windows. Those are not {{project_name_short}} issues. {{project_name_short}} developers cannot fix those issues. One issue is, that Windows is closed source. Additionally, Windows is affected by [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TransparentProxyLeaks Transparent Proxy Leaks] and [[Windows Hosts|other issues]]. For more information and depending on your security requirements, read the following chapters.

== Easy ==
'''Configure network.'''

* Windows 11: Cannot change networking settings according to the following documentation? Check [https://youtu.be/ZkdWSWMdUmU?t=165 this video]. Then use the settings below.
* For {{Code2|Windows}} 7 (similar in {{Code2|Windows}} XP): In Control Panel &rarr; Network and Sharing Center: click on "Change adapter settings" Right-click on local area connection > properties In property window: double-click Internet Protocol Version 4, use the following settings:

{{CodeSelect|code=
## increment last octet of IP address on additional workstations
IP address 10.152.152.50

<u>To Help finish instruction to Prevent [[Tips_on_Remaining_Anonymous#Refrain_from_"Tor_over_Tor"_Scenarios|Tor over Tor]] when using Tor Browser in Windows-{{project_name_workstation_short}},</u> click on Expand on the right.
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">

These steps are required to use Tor Browser when operating a [[Other_Operating_Systems|{{project_name_customworkstation_short}}]], specifically a Windows-{{project_name_workstation_short}}.

'''1.''' Install Tor Browser.

* [[Tor_Browser/Manual_Download|Download Tor Browser]] from [https://www.torproject.org/download/ The Tor Project] [http://2gzyxa5ihm7nsggfxnu52rck2vv4rvmdlkiu3zzui5du4xyclen53wid.onion/download/index.html (.onion)].
* Verify the download.
* Extract the download.

'''2.''' Use Tor Browser without bundled Tor.

Create a new text file in the folder where Tor Browser was extracted. For example, the file could have the following name.

<pre>
Start TB without Tor.bat
</pre>

Add the following content to that file. <ref>
It is necessary to set the <code>SET TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH=1</code> environment variable, then start Tor Browser. The Tor Browser Launcher add-on will detect this, skip the connection wizard and skip launching Tor.
</ref>

<pre>
SET TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH=1

"Start Tor Browser.lnk"
</pre>

Save.

'''3.''' Configure network settings.

Start Tor Browser.

The following links for removing and changing proxy settings do not apply one-to-one for Windows! [[#Remove Proxy Settings|Removal]] of proxy settings is best avoided, while [[#Change Proxy Settings|changing]] proxy settings is a better choice.

How this is accomplished on Windows is currently undocumented, but user contributions to finish these instructions are most welcome.

'''4.''' Figure out missing instructions.

Missing instructions need to be ported from Linux-specific to Windows-specific, see [[#Configure Tor Browser Settings|{{project_name_short}}-Linux-Workstation#Tor Browser Settings]].

'''5.''' Done.

The process has been completed.

'''Install FreeBSD and upgrade it'''

This is necessary as freebsd-update or pkg do not support socks.

{{CodeSelect|code=
## Base OS patches as root
root_shell> freebsd-update fetch install

#Application updates
root_shell> pkg upgrade
}}

You will need a http proxy chained to tor gateway to torify pkg or freebsd-update, else you risk not installing patches.
Use one of privoxy/proxychains/tsocks when using the {{project_name_gateway_short}}.

Install necessary applications.

{{CodeSelect|code=
root_shell> pkg install privoxy
}}

After this shutdown the VM.

{{CodeSelect|code=
root_shell> shutdown -p now

'''Change the VirtualBox VM settings'''

Choose the newly created VM (for example: myVM) &rarr; Settings &rarr; System &rarr; Motherboard &rarr; Hardware Clock in UTC

System &rarr; Motherboard &rarr; Pointing Device &rarr; PS/2 Mouse (required so that USB controller may be disabled)

System &rarr; Processor &rarr; Enable PAE/NX if available

(Note: It is {{project_name_short}}, not whonix. Case sensitive. Capital W.)

USB &rarr; uncheck Enable USB controller

&rarr; OK

Start VM and proceed to configure the OS inside the VM.

'''Configure network.'''

In your Custom-Workstation. Open a terminal and edit as a privileged user {{Code|/etc/rc.conf}}

You need to configure a single interface, here it is em0, there should not be any other 'ifconfig' statements:

{{CodeSelect|code=
## Increment the octect of IP address for configuring other workstations.
ifconfig_em0="inet 10.152.152.12 netmask 255.255.192.0"
defaultrouter="10.152.152.10"
}}

For the address resolution to work. {{Open with root rights|
filename=/etc/resolv.conf
}}

and delete everything, then add

{{CodeSelect|code=
nameserver 10.152.152.10
}}

Restart network service:

{{CodeSelect|code=
root_shell> service netif restart
}}

Confirm changes by running ifconfig.

'''Linux Network Management Software Setup'''

Linux has many applications able to configure networking. To name a few:

* ifupdown
* NetworkManager
* systemd-networkd

See also https://wiki.debian.org/NetworkConfiguration

This is therefore dependent on the Linux distribution being used.

Choose which inux Network Management Software your custom Linux operating system is using or use the Generic Instructions.

= More security =

Recommendations:

* Verify operating system installation CD, compare with sha256 hash or even better verify the gpg signature, if available.
* Install while the Virtual Machine has no internet connection.
* Set your username to ''user''.
* Disable Internet Time Syncing.
* Set your Time Zone to ''UTC''.
* Set up a static IP.
* In case you want to run more than one {{project_name_workstation_short}} at the same time, it is recommended reading the Introduction in the [[Multiple Whonix-Workstation|Multiple {{project_name_workstation_short}}]] article.
* Read [[Documentation#Basic_Security_Guide| Basic Security Guide]], [[Documentation#Advanced_Security_Guide| Advanced Security Guide]], [[Documentation]] and [[Design]] (which is {{project_name_short}}-Example-Implementation-Workstation (based on Debian GNU/Linux) specific) and try to apply as much from it to Windows as possible.

Recommendations:

* Prevent [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TransparentProxyLeaks Transparent Proxy Leaks] by disabling {{project_name_gateway_short}} Transparent Proxy feature. Instead use your Windows {{project_name_workstation_short}} behind an [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TorifyHOWTO/IsolatingProxy Isolating Proxy]. See [[Stream Isolation]] for more information and instructions on how to [[Stream Isolation#Better Protection|disable the Transparent Proxy feature]].
* Check your host clock out of band (use a watch or atomic clock).
* Set your host and your Workstation clock to show seconds as well. After booting the {{project_name_short}}-Windows-Workstation, add a random skew to your clock, maybe +/- 1 to 30 seconds. Optimal values are still under investigation. For reference, see [[TimeSync|{{project_name_short}} Secure And Distributed Time Synchronization Mechanism]], it is {{project_name_short}}-Example-Implementation-Workstation (based on Debian GNU/Linux) specific, but most information also applies to Windows.

The {{project_name_short}}-Download-Workstation is already preconfigured with all {{project_name_short}} extra security features.

A {{project_name_customworkstation_short}} ''can be made'' (Your responsibility!) as secure as a {{project_name_short}}-Download-Workstation. If you simply create <ref>Install or use a Live CD/DVD into {{project_name_workstation_short}}.</ref> a {{project_name_customworkstation_short}}, it still has ''some'' security advantages, for example full IP/DNS protocol leak protection, but ''not all'', for example it lacks Secure Distributed Network Time Synchronization. The details are listed in the table above.
