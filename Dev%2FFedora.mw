Considerations for recommending Fedora as a host operating system...

Website

* Looks much more friendly and modern.
* It is available over SSL.
* [https://getfedora.org/security/ Verification instructions] are also available over SSL.
* The GPG signing key is available over SSL.

Package Manager

* yum is considered as safe as apt according to the theupdateframework.com people.

Considerations for using it as a Virtual Machine Guest

(i.e. for {{project_name_gateway_long}} and {{project_name_workstation_long}})

* Is there a tool to create virtual machine images like there is grml-debootstrap for Debian?
** The feature set of grml-debootstrap seems to provide a one-liner solution for getting a fully working install.
** Fedora supports kickstart files, which are equivalent to Debian preseeding. It should conceivably not be too difficult to achieve a grml-debootstrap experience using kickstart files plus some minimal scripting (if one does not already exist). Fedora has automated builds for Docker images.
* The more restrictive approach taken by SELinux (which is the default in Fedora) might offer some security benefits.

In-Place Release Upgrades:

* Can be release-upgraded in-place from one major release to another. <ref>https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/upgrading/</ref>

Release Cycle:

* <blockquote>Fedora has a relatively short life cycle: each version is usually supported for at least 13 months, where version X is supported only until 1 month after version X+2 is released and with approximately 6 months between most versions.</blockquote>
* Can {{project_name_long}} keep up with that?

Conflict of Interest:

* Fedora won't really become stable since that would obsolete RHEL?

Package Repository:

* Smaller than Debian?

apt-transport-tor:

* The DNF equivalent is python3-dnf-plugin-torproxy.

Fedora doesn't seem to care about [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Reproducible_Builds Reproducible Builds].

Other considerations:

* Has not been considered yet.
* What would be particularly interesting is if {{project_name_short}} could provide a generalized set of scripts to set up the target environment in a distro-agnostic way (perhaps by leveraging Ansible or similar). Creating a working Fedora version in addition to Debian might be a step toward that. &rarr; Unrealistic. Would require a dedicated [[Contribute#Contributor|contributor]]. A port causes a huge amount of work.
* Also interesting would be a containerized version of the {{project_name_gateway_short}} that could be easily deployed on a host OS (this provides less anonymity than what {{project_name_short}} mainly aims for, but serves different use cases): for example, setting up an OnionPi-style hotspot. Current solutions, like the Adafruit OnionPi tutorial, are (1) not very easily deployable, (2) not as feature-rich, for example, limited to HTTP or specific protocols, not full isolating proxies, and (3) tend to have a large footprint on the host/root OS. -- ideally, one Raspi could be used both for providing a Tor Hotspot and for numerous other functions, with the Tor hotspot functions contained in one LXC and using only a handful of ports and hardware interfaces from the host OS. &rarr; Same as above.

= Debugging Scriptlets =
1) Add the prerun scriptlet to a file by running the following command (credit<ref>Thanks to airfishey for the [https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/214192/whats-the-fedora-equivalent-of-var-lib-dpkg-info-prerm/214193#214193 answer] on unix.stackexchange.</ref>):

<pre>
rpm -q --queryformat '%{PREUN}\n' qubes-template-whonix-gw-experimental > ~/qubes-template-whonix-gw-experimental.preun
</pre>

2) Run that script as root while having {{Code2|errexit}}, {{Code2|xtrace}} enabled and output the exit code:

<pre>
sudo sh -ex ~/qubes-template-whonix-gw-experimental.preun 0 ; echo $?
</pre>

Trivia:<br />
The file name {{Code2|qubes-template-whonix-gw-experimental.preun}} actually doesn't matter. You could use a shorter file name.

= misc =
<pre>
sudo yum langinstall de
</pre>

Requires a newer version of yum. So at the moment, the easiest solution is using a Fedora-based VM as UpdateVM.

<pre>
sudo qubes-dom0-update langinstall de
</pre>
