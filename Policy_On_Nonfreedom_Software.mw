{{project_name_long}} recommends to [[Avoid_nonfreedom_software|Avoid Non-Freedom Software]] and will not bundle any unnecessary, major non-freedom software software components or contribute to these.

= Platform Specific =
{{project_name_long}} supports multiple virtualizers. VirtualBox is one among them. For VirtualBox specific Freedom Software issues vs non-issues, see {{kicksecure_wiki

|text=VirtualBox Open Source vs Closed Source

|-

! scope="row"| Permitted Topics
|
* Helping users who ask about non-freedom software; for example - "How do I use Wickr?" Answer: "See the [[Wickr]] wiki page."
* Community-contributed documentation about popular non-freedom software such as [[VMware]] and Hyper-V.
* Discussions about Freedom Software that do or might contain [[Miscellaneous Threats to User Freedom]], for example that rely on Non-Freedom server software such as the [[Telegram]] Client (Freedom Software) that requires connections to the Telegram server (Non-Freedom Software).
* Discussion about Freedom Software alternatives to non-freedom software; for example - "What's a Libre alternative to team viewer?" Answer: "See the [[Remote Administration]] wiki page."
* Running {{project_name_long}} on top of non-freedom operating systems such as [[Windows]] and [[macOS]].
* Non-freedom [[Firmware Security and Updates]] and [[Firmware_Security_and_Updates#Processor_Microcode_Updates|Processor Microcode Updates]].
|-

! scope="row"| Prohibited Topics
|
* Unsolicited recommendations of non-freedom applications; for example - "How do I use remote support?" Answer: "Use anydesk" (prohibited).
* Debates about the features and security of closed vs Open Source Software are unwelcome.
|-

! scope="row"| Contributions to Non-Freedom Software
|
* Examples include Non-freedom software hypervisors such as VMware <ref>
https://forums.whonix.org/t/vmware-maintainer/9239
</ref> and Hyper-V.
* Unless [[Premium_Support|paying for premium support]] (and hosted on separate website if hosted), it must be hosted without references to the {{project_name_long}} [[Trademark Policy|trademark]] and website.
|-

! scope="row"| Non-Freedom Firmware for upcoming [[{{project_name_short}}-Host]]
|
The current [[Dev/nonfree|position on nonfreedom software]]:

* Mostly theoretic since it will take a long time until {{project_name_short}}-Host will be released.
* [https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-host-nonfree-blobs-firmware-linux-nonfree-technical-discussion-only/7356 non-freedom firmware technical-only forum discussion]
* [https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-host-nonfree-blobs-firmware-linux-nonfree/7251 non-freedom software project philosophy discussion]
|-

! scope="row"| Policy Rationale
| This policy has been devised for the following reasons:
* Avoiding endless, circular and non-productive debates.
* Clearly defining the {{project_name_long}} project philosophy.
* [[Avoid_nonfreedom_software|Avoiding Non-Freedom Software]]
* [[Reporting_Bugs#Community_Feedback|Community Feedback Policy]]
* Brand protection - the {{project_name_long}} project is known to be a Freedom Software project that routes all communications over the [[Tor]] network. It is undesirable to harm this brand by bundling it with unnecessary non-freedom software components.

= GNU FSDG Free System Distribution Guidelines =
[https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html GNU project's Free GNU/Linux distributions page] lists the GNU/Linux distributions that are entirely free as in freedom. It however lists only operating systems primarily run as host operating system.

Until the first stable version of [[Whonix-Host]] gets available, this is one reason {{project_name_long}} cannot fully comply with [https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.en.html Free System Distribution Guidelines (GNU FSDG)] and can therefore cannot yet be added to the list. ([https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-and-free-system-distribution-guidelines-gnu-fsdg/5877 forum discussion]).

To understand the following table with GNU FSDG requirements and the self-assessment by {{project_name_long}}, the reader must probably read the GNU project's [https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.en.html Free System Distribution Guidelines (GNU FSDG)] first.

! scope="col"| '''GNU FSDG Requirement'''
! scope="col"| '''Self-Assessment by {{project_name_long}}'''
|-

| Complete Distros
| This is not possible because {{project_name_long}} is primarily run inside virtual machines while GNU's list only lists host operating systems.
|-

| All information for practical use in a free distribution must be available in source form.
| Passed.
|-

| The information, and the source, must be provided under an appropriate free license.
| Passed.
|-

| A free system distribution must not steer users towards obtaining any nonfree information for practical use, or encourage them to do so.
| A few popularly requested applications such as [[Wickr]] are documented but discouraged in documentation.
|-

| The system should have no repositories for nonfree software
| {{project_name_long}} is based on Debian. The contrib and nonfree repository is enabled by default for better usability but no packages from these repositories are ever installed by default as per policy. ([https://forums.whonix.org/t/adding-non-freedom-contrib-non-free-apt-repositories-by-default-is-it-safe/3300 forum discussion])
|-

| The system no specific recipes for installation of particular nonfree programs
| A few popularly requested applications such as [[Wickr]] are documented but discouraged in documentation.
|-

| Digital Restrictions Management (DRM)
| Passed. There is no built-in DRM.
|-

| Nonfree Firmware
| Passed. See above chapter.
|-

| Trademarks
| Passed. See [[Trademark Policy]].
|-

| All the documentation in a free system distribution must be released under an appropriate free license.
| Passed.
|-

| Additionally, it must take care not to recommend nonfree software.
| Nonfreedom-software is discouraged.
|-

| Patents
| Passed.
|-

| No Malware
| Passed.
|-

| Commitment to Correct Mistakes
| Yes.
|-

| distribution should be actively maintained
| Passed.
|-

| Name Confusion
| Passed, there is no name confusion.
|-

| Please Teach Users about Free Software
| Passed.
|-

| Please Avoid Repeating Propaganda and Confusion
| Passed.
|-

| Issues inherited from Debian
| Since [[About#Based_on _Debian|{{project_name_long}} is based on Debian]], it inherits all FSDG issues that Debian is affected by. LibrePlanet has a [https://libreplanet.org/wiki/List_of_software_that_does_not_respect_the_Free_System_Distribution_Guidelines long list of Debian FSDG issues]. That list however seems was last updated a few years ago. Many of the linked issues are actually resolved as per the replies by Debian Developers. For further determination, as a first step, a contributor would have to update that list and remove the already resolved issues.
