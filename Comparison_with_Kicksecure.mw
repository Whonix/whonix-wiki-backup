= Comparison with Kicksecure =

Both {{project_name_short}} and {{Kicksecure}} are Linux distributions based on Debian and developed by some of the same contributors. However, they serve different purposes:

== Key Differences ==
'''Security vs Anonymity'''

* Kicksecure focuses on system security without enforcing anonymity.
* {{project_name_short}} [[Reliable IP Hiding|reliably forces all traffic through Tor]] and provides anonymity features ([[About#Full_Spectrum_Anti-Tracking_Protection|Full Spectrum Anti-Tracking Protection]] - protects against many types of tracking, not just IP exposure).

'''Network Routing'''

* Kicksecure does not route all traffic through Tor by default.
* {{project_name_short}} uses two virtual machines - one called the Gateway (for connecting to Tor) and one called the Workstation (for user activity) - to ensure all internet traffic is anonymized.

'''Intended Use Cases'''

* Kicksecure: For users needing a hardened Linux environment without requiring anonymity.
* {{project_name_short}}: For users requiring anonymity and privacy protections.

== When to Use Kicksecure ==
* For applications needing security hardening without anonymity.

== When to Use Whonix ==
* For tasks that require guaranteed Tor routing and anonymity.

== Can Kicksecure Be Used Instead of Whonix? ==
No. While both share many features, they are designed for different use cases. {{Kicksecure}} cannot provide the same anonymity guarantees as {{project_name_short}}.

== What are you trying to achieve? ==

* "I need security but don't need Tor routing" → Use Kicksecure.
* "I need anonymity or Tor routing" → Use Whonix.

== Why are there two separate projects? ==
Kicksecure and Whonix have different goals: one focuses on security (Kicksecure), and the other on anonymity (Whonix).
