In this configuration network traffic will (1) enter the tunnel-link and pass through your ISP &rarr; (2) exit your tunnel-link server as encrypted Tor traffic&rarr; (3) enter to the Tor network&rarr; (4) exit the Tor network at a Tor exit node as normal internet traffic (encrypted or unencrypted).

''' Possible uses: '''
* You must connect to your tunnel-link to access the internet.
* Your ISP blocks Tor and Tor bridges but doesnâ€™t block the tunnel-link.
* Fear of de-anonymizing attacks against the Tor network; belief that your tunnel-link is able to protect your identity in such case.
