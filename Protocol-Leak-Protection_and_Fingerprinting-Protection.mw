Protection from IP Leaks, DNS Leaks, Protocol Leaks and Fingerprinting. Analysis of host hardware identifiers visible or hidden inside virtual machines.
}}
= Introduction =
{{project_name_long}} cannot do the impossible and magically prevent every kind of [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TorifyHOWTO#protocol-leaks protocol leak] and identifier disclosure:

<blockquote>Tor provides only anonymity for DNS and the transmission of the TCP stream. Everything inside the stream, the application protocol, needs to be scrubbed. For example, if the application uses advanced techniques to determine your real external IP and sends it over the anonymized TCP stream, then what you wanted to hide, your real external IP, isn't hidden.
...

Many applications can also leak other problematic and/or sensitive data, such as:

* Your real external non-Tor IP address, as described above
* Your time zone (for example: IRC clients through CTCP)
* Your user name (for example: ssh through login)
* The name and version of the client or server you are using (for example: Apache web server leaks software name and version number; IRC clients leak client name and client version number through CTCP)
* Metadata can be a risk. See [https://github.com/jvoisin/mat2?tab=readme-ov-file#metadata-and-privacy MAT2's metadata and privacy documentation].
* Depending on your Mode Of Anonymity you obviously shouldn't mix your use of protected (anonymous) applications with applications not passing through the Tor network or some other form of anonymity. For example, if a login name or password of yours can be traced back to your personal identity, then you are defeating the purpose entirely. Tor can not protect you from this kind of activity
* Even sending the contents of your RAM can be dangerous. (For example: error reporting, leading to Transparent Proxy Leaks)
* A lot of information which the application sends on request from a server (for example: most web browsers beside the Tor Browser)
* Hardware serial numbers might be used for fingerprinting and in the worst case scenario, lead back to you.
* License keys of non-freedom software is often transmitted and might lead back to you.</blockquote>

Despite the many risks, {{project_name_short}} is designed to offer multiple layers of defense for the best possible protection against inadvertent deanonymization.

= {{project_name_short}} Advantages =

== Protection Against Serious Leaks ==

{{project_name_short}} protects against the most dangerous leak categories outlined below, which would otherwise divulge the user's real identity (remotely or directly):

* The real, external, non-Tor IP address is hidden due to the fundamental {{project_name_short}} design, use of an isolated proxy, and the [[Whonix-Gateway Firewall]]. <ref name=one>
This does not cover application vulnerabilities and exploits, which escalate from the virtual machine to the host. See: [[Comparison_with_Others#Attacks|Attacks]]. However, by design the {{project_name_workstation_long}} does not know its own external non-Tor IP address.
</ref>
* The same applies for DNS<ref name=one /> requests; they are safe. <ref>
<code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> in {{project_name_workstation_short}} is configured to use the {{project_name_gateway_long}} as the DNS resolver, which is routed through Tor.
</ref>

== Numerous Default Applications are Pre-configured Against Leaks ==

Developers have taken care to prevent common applications from leaking information that could identify users, including:

* <u>[[Stream Isolation]]</u>: Configuring applications to use their own SocksPort, thus preventing Identity correlation through circuit sharing.
* <u>Browser fingerprinting</u>: {{project_name_short}} [[Tor Browser|includes Tor Browser]] by default. The browser fingerprint is as good (or bad) as using the normal Tor Browser bundle from torproject.org
* <u>GPG</u>: <code>/home/user/.gnupg/gpg.conf</code> is optimized for privacy; see footnote. <ref>
Adhering to [https://github.com/ioerror/torbirdy/pull/11 recommendations] as per the [https://github.com/ioerror/torbirdy/blob/master/gpg.conf torbirdy github repository], which prevents leakage of the operating system version (no-emit-version) and other variables ([https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/security-misc/blob/master/etc/skel/.gnupg/gpg.conf on github]).</ref>
* <u>ssh</u>: Without {{project_name_short}}, the syntax for ssh is user@hostname [...]. However, if a specific user is not nominated before @hostname, the operating system user name will be utilized instead. If that value is something identifiable, then anonymity is broken. Since {{project_name_short}} defaults the user name to <code>user</code>, in the worst case only the username <code>user</code> can be leaked, which is harmless. <ref>
In this case it may appear that the syntax was simply copied from the manpage.</ref> <ref>
The Tails OS similarly sets the username to <code>amnesia</code>, which is a default value not set by the user and therefore safe.</ref>
* [[Dev/Default_Application_Policy|Default Application Policy]]

Many protocol leaks are already documented, see: [[Documentation]] and [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TorifyHOWTO TorifyHOWTO] for further information.

= Identifiers =

In addition to protocol leaks, there are also a range of identifiers that can be used for fingerprinting by adversaries for anonymity set reduction (for example, the time zone), or even for complete deanonymization (for example, if the user name was set to the user's actual name). Such identifiers are described below.

{{Anchor|Minor Identifiers}}

== Hardware Identifiers ==
These identifiers are less important because an adversary can only collect them if the user installed malicious software (for example, some copyright enforcement and anti-cheat tools collect them), or if the adversary achieves remote access by compromising a user or in some cases the root account.

Hardware identifiers are virtualizer specific issues were all virtualizers are affected and therefore [[Unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]].

These were hidden by VirtualBox "Synthetic CPU" in the past but that feature was removed from VirtualBox. (Even then the clock speed of your host CPU was visible to all code (applications or malware) inside {{project_name_workstation_short}}.) [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T408 The parameters <code>--cpuid-portability-level</code> or <code>--cpuidremoveall</code> have been tested and do not hide CPU model and capabilities either.]

This is due to the design of virtualization platforms (VirtualBox, KVM, Xen, Qubes, VMware, etc.). Most virtualization platforms leak CPU model, capabilities and clock speed. Check.

A workaround in theory could be to use an emulator instead of a virtualizer such as [[QEMU]] or [https://bochs.sourceforge.net/ bochs]. In practice however, unfortunately such emulators are slow and there might be other limitations. (Does Bochs support internal networking?)

{{CodeSelect|code=

Inside {{project_name_workstation_short}} and then compare it with the host.
</ref> <ref>
Disadvantages if a shared MAC Addresses would be used by all {{project_name_workstation_short}}:

* [[Multiple Whonix-Workstation|Multiple {{project_name_workstation_short}}]] cannot use the Internet at the same time if they are using the same MAC address. It leads to confusing connection interruptions in either of the virtual machines.
* The project contributors need to explain and defend the design, which takes a lot of time for little gain. (Again, it is important not to expose the host's real MAC address, but so long as the one inside the virtual machine is different, everything is in an acceptable state.)

Advantages if a shared MAC Addresses would be used by all {{project_name_workstation_short}}:

* It may be easier to develop [[Connections between Gateway and Workstation#ARP_spoofing_defense|ARP spoofing defense]] to implement authenticated connections between {{project_name_gateway_short}} and {{project_name_workstation_short}}. (This is only useful when using [[Multiple Whonix-Workstation|Multiple {{project_name_workstation_short}}]].) To understand the context, please read [[Connections between Gateway and Workstation]].
* In some cases, applications gather the MAC address and send it to a remote server (proprietary license checks use the MAC for hardware fingerprinting). In this case a shared MAC address might be better for privacy. It however might also break the proprietary license check as this expects different MAC addresses for different customers of the proprietary software. See also [[VM Fingerprinting]].
* There might be an advantages of sharing MAC addresses among all {{project_name_short}} versions. That would be useful in the event an application leaks the MAC address or if {{project_name_workstation_short}} was compromised. On the other hand, this would identify the user as a {{project_name_short}} user.

= Identifiers Design Goals =

Should the goal be,

* '''A)''' <u>a shared personality:</u> to have all {{project_name_short}} appear with the same uniform fingerprint at all times, OR
* '''B)''' <u>a virtual personality:</u> to invent and emulate a different unique fingerprint for each user?

In other words, should each {{project_name_short}} system look exactly the same to observers, or should it try to look different for every user?

The same question rephrased in more technical terms: should identifiers such as <code>/etc/machine-id</code>:

* '''A)''' <u>shared:</u> be the same across all {{project_name_short}} systems, OR
* '''B)''' <u>unique:</u> be regenerated for each user at every system boot?

{{project_name_short}} design, at the time of writing, is A). <ref>
https://github.com/Whonix/dist-base-files
</ref> It may be possible to argue for either option. However, upon consideration, it seems clear that A) offers greater privacy in the context of how {{project_name_short}} is used.

The threat model being considered here is that some software inside {{project_name_workstation_short}} might read system identifiers — such as the machine ID — and send them to a remote server. That remote server could then use this identifier to recognize or track users. This type of software can be described as privacy-invasive or, in more severe cases, malicious.

Choosing option A) does mean that the machine ID reveals, "this is a {{project_name_short}} system." However, avoiding this kind of leakage is realistically not possible. For a deeper explanation, refer to the [[VM Fingerprinting]] page and the {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=System_identity_camouflage
|text=System Identity Camouflage
}} wiki pages. This is a general problem and is [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]]. In fact, if an application or malware wants to track users, it can simply generate its own identifier and use that. Therefore, trying to hide system-level identifiers like <code>/etc/machine-id</code> does not meaningfully increase privacy in most cases.

Tor and the Tor Browser take a similar approach to this issue. They do not try to generate a new random identity (pseudonym) each time they are used. Instead, their strategy is to make all users appear the same to outside observers. The Tor Project refers to this concept as <code>Anonymity Loves Company</code> (you can search the web for this term for more background). Since {{project_name_short}} is designed as an extension of Tor, it follows the same principle.

Option B) would avoid revealing that a system is running {{project_name_short}}, but actually hiding this fact is not practically achievable, as explained in [[VM Fingerprinting]].

There is also a trade-off between two goals: complete resistance to fingerprinting by local software, and applying strong system hardening for better security. Unfortunately, when the system is hardened for security, this itself becomes a fingerprint: it reveals that the system has been customized or secured, which may make it more identifiable. Since it is impossible to achieve both goals perfectly, {{project_name_short}} prioritizes security hardening whenever these goals conflict.

When not using virtual machines (VMs),  privacy-invasive software running on the host system has even greater ability to fingerprint users, because it can directly access hardware identifiers such as serial numbers, MAC addresses, or CPU features.
