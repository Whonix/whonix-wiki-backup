It is challenging to set up OpenVPN on {{project_name_short}} with a secure, leak-preventing [[#Fail Closed Mechanism|Fail Closed Mechanism]]. For this reason, it is strongly recommended to first exercise outside of {{project_name_short}} and learn how to set up OpenVPN on Debian stable (currently {{stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}}). The following steps are a simple overview of the process:

# "Forget" about {{project_name_short}} for a while
# Prepare a Debian <code>{{stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}}</code> VM.
# Install the Debian OpenVPN package: <code>sudo apt install openvpn</code>.
# Research how to set up a VPN using OpenVPN on the command line. Only proceed if this is successful. Please do not post support requests regarding these instructions before completing this basic exercise as this is [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]].
# Search for help with general VPN setup in the [[#VPN Setup|VPN Setup]] section or in the [[Tunnels/Examples|VPN Tunnel Setup Examples]] chapter. [[Support|Help]] is available from various sources, and the VPN provider may also be of assistance.
# Only then proceed attempting to replicate a similar setup with {{project_name_short}}.
