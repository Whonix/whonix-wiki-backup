How-to: Connect from Whonix-Workstation (client) to another Whonix-Workstation (server). (Esoteric Documentation)
}}
= Instructions =
'''1.''' Multiple workstation setup.

Follow the usual documentation on how to set up [[Multiple Whonix-Workstation]].

'''2.''' Server installation.

Install the server software in the [[Whonix-Workstation]] (server) which is supposed to be reachable from another Whonix-Workstation.

'''3.''' Firewall settings.

incoming:

The Whonix-Workstation which is supposed to provide a server service (open port) needs to be configured to [[Whonix-Workstation_Firewall#Open_an_Incoming_Port|open an incoming port in Whonix-Workstation firewall]].

outgoing:

The Whonix-Workstation (client) which connect to the other Whonix-Workstation (server) does not need any special configuration.

'''4.''' Reading [[Stream_Isolation/Easy]] might help.

'''5.''' If you need to connect to localhost for testing purposes, refer also to [[Local Connections]].

'''6.''' If using curl (or other applications that are configured for [[Stream Isolation]] by default in Whonix) for local connections or connections to other Whonix-Workstations, the stream isolation wrapper uwt needs to be disabled or circumvented. Curl stream isolation circumvention example:

Do not use:

<pre>
curl
</pre>

Instead use:

{{CodeSelect|code=
curl.anondist-orig
}}

'''7.''' Tor Browser notice.

Also [[Tor Browser]] might be difficult to use for this purpose. This is due to the design of Tor Browser for its specialized use case by its original developers. This is [[unspecific|unspecific to Whonix]].

'''8.''' Done.
