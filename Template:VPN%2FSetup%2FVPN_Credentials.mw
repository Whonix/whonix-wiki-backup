For this <u>example</u>, for this step, a Riseup account is required. Unfortunately, the former free VPN service is no longer available. <ref>
Previously a VPN secret (VPN password) and username could be registered.
</ref> This means to create an account you will need an "invite code" from a current Riseup user.

* If you <u>have</u> one:
** '''1.''' Navigate to the [https://account.riseup.net/user/new account creation page] in Tor Browser.
** '''2.''' Enter the invite code.
** '''3.''' Choose a username unrelated to your real identity.
** '''4.''' Enter a [[Passwords|strong password]].
* <u>If you do '''not''' have an invite code</u>:
** Please do <u>not</u> ask {{project_name_short}} developers or forums for an invite code because none will be available.
** Instead tailor the instructions in this section to <u>work with any other OpenVPN provider</u>.

'''1.''' {{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/openvpn/auth.txt
}}

'''2.''' Add.

Note: Replace <code>riseupusername</code> with the actual Riseup user name and replace <code>vpnsecret</code> with the <i>actual</i> user name and password or just go to [https://account.riseup.net/ account.riseup.net], log in and click on "VPN".

<pre>
riseupusername
vpnsecret
</pre>

'''3 .''' Save and exit.
