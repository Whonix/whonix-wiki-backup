{{Quotation
|quote=I use Qubes and a Whonix gateway literally everyday, but you can't simply throw Qubes at a non-technical journalist and have them not get you arrested. Qubes is intended for people who understand how a network operates and what a virtual machine is. Most journalists don't.

{{Quotation
|quote=I'd disable javascript, tracking, and fingerprinting in the browser, and even then I'd avoid the browser unless I had no choice. Better to browse on a laptop (w/ @QubesOS) which does not have a history of everywhere I've been, since it lacks GPS & Wifi, and has @Whonix built-in.
