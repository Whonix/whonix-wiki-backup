<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
Notes:

* This is only required if changes were made to the <code>derivative-maker</code> source folder.
* This is not required if only a customized build configuration was added to the <code>/etc/buildconfig-dist.d</code> folder.

<pre>
--allow-uncommitted true
</pre>

<pre>
--allow-untagged true
</pre>

Otherwise, changes must be committed to git first, before creating a git tag.
