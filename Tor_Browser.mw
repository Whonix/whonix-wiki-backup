[https://www.torproject.org/download/ Tor Browser] <ref>
https://tb-manual.torproject.org/
</ref> is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development) fork] of the Mozilla [https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/enterprise/ Firefox ESR] web browser. It is developed by [https://www.torproject.org/ The Tor Project] and [https://2019.www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/ optimized] and [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/torbutton/en/design/ designed] for [[Tor]], anonymity, and security. <ref>
https://blogs.gnome.org/muelli/2018/12/the-patch-that-converts-a-firefox-to-a-tor-browser/
</ref> Most users will have browsed with Firefox and will be familiar with the user interface, which resembles those found in other popular, modern browsers. <ref>
A good overview of the browser component is provided by [https://2019.www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#Implementation The Tor Project design document].

<blockquote>The Tor Browser is based on Mozilla's Extended Support Release (ESR) Firefox branch. We have a series of patches against this browser to enhance privacy and security. Browser behavior is additionally augmented through the Torbutton extension, though we are in the process of moving this functionality into direct Firefox patches. We also change a number of Firefox preferences from their defaults.

Tor process management and configuration are accomplished through the Tor Launcher add-on, which provides the initial Tor configuration splash screen and bootstrap progress bar. Tor Launcher is also compatible with Thunderbird, Instantbird, and XULRunner.

To help protect against potential Tor Exit Node eavesdroppers, we include HTTPS-Everywhere. To provide users with optional defense-in-depth against JavaScript and other potential exploit vectors, we also include NoScript. We also modify several extension preferences from their defaults.

To provide censorship circumvention in areas where the public Tor network is blocked either by IP or by protocol fingerprint, we include several Pluggable Transports in the distribution. As of this writing, we include Obfs3proxy, Obfs4proxy, Scramblesuit, meek, and FTE.</blockquote>

It is strongly encouraged to read this entire chapter so Tor Browser is used effectively and safely on the {{project_name_short}} platform. Advanced users may also be interested in the [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#Tor_Browser_Adversary_Model|Tor Browser Adversary Model]].

= Encryption =

== HTTPS Encryption ==

It is important to understand the difference between HTTP and HTTPS: <ref name=whatishttps>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS</ref>

<blockquote>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol Hypertext Transfer Protocol] (HTTP). It is used for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_security secure communication] over a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_operating_system computer network] and is widely used on the Internet. In HTTPS, the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol communication protocol] is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption encrypted] using [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security Transport Layer Security] (TLS) or, formerly, its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also often referred to as HTTP over TLS or HTTP over SSL. <br />

The principal motivation for HTTPS is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication authentication] of the accessed [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website website] and protection of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy privacy] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity integrity] of the exchanged data while in transit. ...</blockquote>

=== HTTPS Advantages ===

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Only rely on services providing HTTPS when sensitive information is sent or received. Otherwise, passwords, financial / personal information, or other sensitive data can be easily stolen or intercepted by eavesdroppers. HTTP webpage contents can also be modified on their way to the browser for malicious purposes.
}}

HTTPS advantages include: <ref name=whatishttps />

* Authentication of the website and web server that is being communicated with.
* Protection against [[Warning#Man-in-the-middle_Attacks|Man-in-the-middle attacks]].
* Bidirectional encryption of communications between a client and server. This protects against [[Warning#Exit_Relays_can_Eavesdrop_on_Communications|eavesdropping]] and tampering with or forging communication contents.
* A <i>reasonable</i> expectation that the website being communicated with is genuine. <ref>HTTPS is not foolproof due to reliance on the Certificate Authority (CA) system that issues digital certificates (private keys) for websites. As a trusted third party, this trust can be abused, or the CAs can be subject to adversary attacks.</ref>

In the Tor Browser context, this means HTTPS should be preferred over HTTP so communication is encrypted while browsing the Internet. While traffic is encrypted throughout the Tor network, the exit relay (third of three servers) can see traffic sent into Tor if it is plain HTTP. If HTTPS is used, the exit relay will only know the destination address. <ref>
https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/faq#AmITotallyAnonymous
</ref>

As an example, the screenshot below captures the browser appearance when visiting the {{project_name_short}} website. <ref>https://www.whonix.org</ref>

'''Figure:''' ''A Secure Connection to www.whonix.org''

[[File:tbbbbbb.png|600px]]

Take note of the small, left-hand area of the address bar. Indicators of an encrypted connection are: <code>www.whonix.org</code> is highlighted with a padlock and "<span style="color:#008000">Secure Connection</span>" in green writing, and the URL begins with ''https://'' instead of ''http://''.

=== HTTPS-Only Mode ===

Nowadays, when visiting a website that does not support encryption (HTTP<code>S</code>), Tor Browser will show a warning. This is because HTTPS-Only Mode is now enabled by default in Tor Browser.

'''Figure:''' ''Tor Browser HTTPS-Only Mode Alert - Warning when visiting an unencrypted (HTTP only) website''

=== HTTP / HTTPS Connections with and without Tor ===

The following figures from EFF provide an overview of HTTP / HTTPS connections with and without Tor, and what information is visible to various third parties. The descriptors are as follows: <ref>https://www.eff.org/pages/tor-and-https</ref>

<blockquote>Potentially visible data includes: the site you are visiting (SITE.COM), your username and password (USER/PW), the data you are transmitting (DATA), your IP address (LOCATION), and whether or not you are using Tor (TOR).</blockquote>

== Onion Services Encryption ==

Whenever possible, utilize [[Onion_Services|Onion Services]] (<code>.onion</code> addresses) so communications and web browsing stay within the Tor network. These resources are still commonly referred to as "hidden services," even when their location is publicly known. <ref>
https://riseup.net/en/security/network-security/tor/onionservices-best-practices
</ref>

=== Onion Services Advantages ===

URLs ending in the <code>.onion</code> extension provide a superior level of security and privacy since the connection forms a tunnel that is encrypted (end-to-end) using a random rendezvous point within the Tor network; HTTPS is not required. These connections also incorporate [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy perfect forward secrecy (PFS)]. PFS ensures that the compromise of long-term keys does not affect past session keys. As a result, past encrypted communications and sessions cannot be retrieved and decrypted if long-term secret keys or passwords are compromised in the future by adversaries. <ref>This does not, however, defend against improved cryptanalysis that breaks the underlying ciphers being used, such as the potential emergence of quantum computers. Only post-quantum ciphers resistant to these attacks will prevail.</ref>

Onion services provide several other benefits: <ref>
https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/onion-services
</ref>

* Passive surveillance by both network observers and the Tor exit node is prevented, unlike the plain Tor + HTTPS configuration. Adversaries cannot easily determine which destination is being accessed.
* Onion services establish "rendezvous points" in the Tor network for web services, meaning neither the hosting service nor the user can discover the other's network identity.
* Onion services can be combined with [[SSL|SSL/TLS]] to provide additional protection. Only a handful of sites currently offer this service with v3 onions, such as DuckDuckGo: https://duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sjasowoarfbgcmvfimaftt6twagswzczad.onion/ <ref>Tests reveal that the v3 onion address defaults to the clearnet search engine if JavaScript is not enabled.</ref> <ref>
Extra layers of encryption are not strictly necessary since a fully encrypted tunnel is already established, but they do provide an additional layer of security. Until recently, these certificates would not validate due to the *.onion hostname.</ref> <ref>https://riseup.net/en/security/network-security/tor/onionservices-best-practices
</ref>
* Onion services do not use the insecure DNS system. Strong authentication comes from the self-authenticating address, where the address itself forms a cryptographic proof of the <code>.onion</code> service's identity. <ref>
https://blog.torproject.org/cooking-onions-names-your-onions
</ref> <ref>
This is why onion addresses appear absurdly long and random.
</ref>

= Tor Browser Add-Ons =

== Introduction ==

Any default add-ons that are installed in Tor Browser should not be removed or disabled in the <code>about:addons</code> page. Tor developers have considered the security and anonymity benefits of this configuration, even though [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/3007 NoScript blocking is disabled (JavaScript is enabled) in Tor Browser by default] (see footnote). <ref>Experienced Tor developer Mike Perry has noted that even with scripts globally enabled, [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/3007#comment:3 NoScript still provides significant protection in Tor Browser]:
<blockquote>We provide NoScript mostly for the non-filter features it provides, such as click-to-play for media, WebGL and plugins, XSS protection, remote font blockage, and so on.</blockquote></ref> Developers have reasoned that this helps to avoid feature breakage and focuses efforts on designing a private browsing environment that does not rely on filters.

== NoScript ==

[[File:noscript.png|NoScript logo|thumb]]

NoScript is a free, open-source extension that comes bundled with Tor Browser and other Mozilla-based web browsers. NoScript can provide significant protection with the correct configuration: <ref name=no_script>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoScript</ref>

<blockquote>By default, NoScript blocks active (executable) web content, which a user can wholly or partially unblock by whitelisting a site or domain from the extension's toolbar menu. Sites can be set as '<code>allowed</code>', '<code>trusted</code>', or '<code>untrusted</code>', and the whitelist persists between sessions. Temporarily allowed sites won't be added to the permanent whitelist and work only until the browser session ends. Active content may consist of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript JavaScript], web fonts, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language) Java], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash Flash], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight Silverlight], and other [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing) plugins]. The add-on also offers specific countermeasures against security exploits. ... This is based on the assumption that malicious websites can use these technologies in harmful ways.</blockquote>

NoScript protects against [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting cross-site scripting] (XSS), whereby attackers inject malicious client-side scripts into destination web pages, bypassing the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy same-origin policy]. <ref><blockquote>XSS effects vary in range from petty nuisance to significant security risk, depending on the sensitivity of the data handled by the vulnerable site and the nature of any security mitigation implemented by the site's owner.</blockquote></ref> The same-origin policy refers to web browser enforcement of permissions -- scripts in the first web page are usually only allowed to access data in a second web page if they have the same origin (URL scheme, hostname, and port number). <ref>[https://noscript.net/faq#clearclick Anti-clickjacking] was previously available to protect against hidden or disguised user interface elements masquerading as trusted web page buttons, links, and so on. This is no longer available following the shift to Firefox extensions in Tor Browser based on Firefox 60 ESR. This feature protected against malicious activation of microphones or webcams, as well as user interaction with hidden elements to steal important financial, personal, or other data.</ref>

When NoScript is enabled, a host of tracking/profiling services are neutralized because they rely on JavaScript. For example, various operating system and browser configuration details are revealed if JavaScript is not disabled. <ref name=no_script /> Another unintended benefit concerns the use of system resources. When JavaScript is disabled, studies reveal that bandwidth consumption can be reduced by more than 40 percent on the top 150 Alexa websites. Similarly, fewer system resources are required to display a web page in the browser. <ref>https://ianix.com/pub/firefox-addons-and-bandwidth-consumption.html</ref>

=== Security vs Usability Trade-off ===

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = The [[#Security_Slider|Security Slider]] (see further below) also involves a security versus usability trade-off. Higher slider levels improve security and reduce usability, while the opposite is true of other settings. Fingerprinting risks are greatly reduced at higher slider levels, but some site functionality may also be lost.
}}

In the stock Tor Browser configuration, JavaScript is enabled by default for greater usability. The Tor Project FAQ provides a rationale for this decision: <ref>
https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/faq#TBBJavaScriptEnabled
</ref>

<blockquote>We configure NoScript to allow JavaScript by default in Tor Browser because many websites will not work with JavaScript disabled. Most users would give up on Tor entirely if a website they want to use requires JavaScript because they would not know how to allow a website to use JavaScript (or that enabling JavaScript might make a website work).<br />
There's a trade-off here. On the one hand, we should leave JavaScript enabled by default so websites work the way users expect. On the other hand, we should disable JavaScript by default to better protect against browser vulnerabilities ([https://blog.torproject.org/tor-security-advisory-old-tor-browser-bundles-vulnerable not just a theoretical concern!]). But there's a third issue: websites can easily determine whether you have allowed JavaScript for them, and if you disable JavaScript by default but then allow a few websites to run scripts (the way most people use NoScript), then your choice of whitelisted websites acts as a sort of cookie that makes you recognizable (and distinguishable), thus harming your anonymity.</blockquote>

The take-home message is disabling all JavaScript with whitelist-based, pre-emptive script-blocking may better protect against vulnerabilities (many attacks are based on scripting), <ref>
JavaScript has previously been used in Windows to [https://www.pcworld.com/article/453223/tor-project-stop-using-windows-disable-javascript.html deanonymize Tor Browser users with a zero-day exploit] which revealed the computer's MAC address to the attackers.
</ref> but it reduces usability on many sites and acts as a fingerprinting mechanism based on the select sites where it is enabled. <ref name=no_script /> On the other hand, allowing JavaScript by default increases usability and the risk of exploitation, but the specific fingerprint has more in common with the larger user pool. <ref>
Having a large user base is important for strong anonymity, as Roger Dingledine explains [https://www.mail-archive.com/liberationtech@lists.stanford.edu/msg00022.html here].
</ref> <ref>
Another related discussion justifying JavaScript's enabling by default was held on tor-talk; see [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-May/024227.html Tor Browser disabling JavaScript anonymity set reduction].
</ref> <ref>
The Tor Project bug report: [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/3007 NoScript configured to globally allow all scripts]
</ref>

Developers are unaware of any JavaScript vulnerabilities that could compromise {{project_name_short}} anonymity. That said, it is inadvisable to change NoScript settings in Tor Browser unless the potential impacts are known. To enable/disable JavaScript, Java, and/or plugin execution, left-click the NoScript status bar icon or use the [https://www.techopedia.com/definition/2828/contextual-menu contextual menu]. <ref>
https://noscript.net/
</ref> Permissions can be granted either temporarily or on a permanent basis using a whitelist. "Temporarily Trusted" will only enable a script(s) for that site until the browser session is closed or until the permission is manually revoked.

For further information, refer to the [https://noscript.net/ NoScript website] and [https://noscript.net/features features overview], or the [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/torbutton/en/design/ Torbutton design document].

=== You should Disable JavaScript by Default! ===
As noted in the [[#Security vs Usability Trade-off|previous section]], disabling JavaScript by default may worsen fingerprinting. There are several other reasons why {{project_name_short}} has not made any modifications:

* <u>Different development team:</u> Tor Browser is developed by a different development team, The Tor Project. From {{project_name_short}}'s (and others') perspective, this is often called upstream because {{project_name_short}}, as a Linux distribution, is downstream from the provider of the software project Tor Browser. For an elaboration on the organizational differences, see {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=Linux User Experience versus Commercial Operating Systems
|text=Linux User Experience versus Commercial Operating Systems
}}.
* <u>Technical challenges:</u> There is no stable application-programmable interface (API) to reliably disable JavaScript by default in Tor Browser.<ref>
https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/25391
</ref> {{project_name_short}} developers cannot use such an API, and there won’t be one<ref>
https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/25391#note_2277828
</ref> unless someone contributes this feature to upstream, Tor Browser.<ref>
{{project_name_short}} previously shipped a desktop file and menu options that affected the [[#Security Slider|security slider]] setting after first launching Tor Browser. However, this feature was removed due to unreliability. See [https://forums.whonix.org/t/ship-an-additional-version-of-tor-browser-with-security-slider-settings-to-high-by-default/7591 this forum thread] for further details.
</ref> Therefore, making this change by default as a Linux distribution is difficult.<ref>
It is easier for Tails to change Tor Browser because it is a live distribution, not a persistent Linux distribution upgradeable through the standard package manager mechanism. Due to Tails' significant effort on Tor Browser customization, Tails might lack [https://www.whonix.org/#security other security features] that were added to Whonix.
</ref>
* <u>Not a browser project:</u> {{project_name_short}} is not a "secure browser" project. Instead, its focus is on creating a stable, reliable anonymity distribution that aligns with best practice security and privacy principles. This approach is informed by educated researchers in the field and is based on other upstream projects as much as possible. Similarly, neither Debian nor Qubes develops secure browser sub-projects; instead, they bundle existing upstream projects.
* <u>User support:</u> As per the [[Self Support First Policy]], support requests, bug reports, and feature requests are [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}} and can almost always be redirected to upstream, the Tor Browser, a much larger and better-funded project.
* <u>Fingerprinting:</u> Possible fingerprinting or security issues with default settings in Tor Browser fall under the domain of core Tor developers.
* <u>Shared fingerprint:</u> Having {{project_name_short}} share the [[Fingerprint|fingerprint]] of other Tor Browser users might be beneficial for anonymity.
* <u>Limited resources:</u> {{project_name_short}} has limited manpower, meaning the resources do not exist to create a more secure browser, even if it were desirable.<ref>
Even if the manpower existed, it would make more sense to establish a new "Privacy Browser" project rather than merge its development with {{project_name_short}}. At a later stage, the theoretically more secure browser could then be bundled with the {{project_name_short}} platform.
</ref> No suitable, ethical, reliable {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=Dev/Open_Source_Business_Models
|text=Open Source Business Model
}} has been found or developed yet.
* <u>Simpler security audits:</u> Tor Browser is not significantly modified for the same reasons {{project_name_short}} does not [[Tor#Does_Whonix_Modify_Tor.3F|modify]] or attempt to [[Tor#Can_Whonix_Improve_Tor.3F|improve]] Tor.<ref>
{{project_name_short}} includes Tor Browser by default, with only [[Tor_Browser#{{project_name_short}}_Tor_Browser_Differences|minor]] differences.
</ref>
* <u>Legal:</u> Potential legal and trademark-related issues.<ref>
Even if Open Source, modifying Tor Browser beyond environment variables might require a rebuild from source code to remove Tor Browser trademarks, which would be a significant effort.

* [[Dev/TPO_Trademark]]
* https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/19652
</ref>

Experienced Tor developer Mike Perry has provided justification for enabling JavaScript by default in a tor-talk mailing list topic. See [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-May/024227.html "Tor Browser disabling Javascript anonymity set reduction"]. In summary, Tor Button and Tor Browser patches handle the most serious JavaScript concerns, such as IP address/location bypass problems.<ref>Although there are unresolved [https://gitlab.torproject.org/search?scope=issues&search=tor+browser+fingerprinting&state=opened tbb-fingerprinting] and [https://gitlab.torproject.org/search?scope=issues&search=linkability&state=opened tbb-linkability] issues.</ref>

Due to the loss of functionality, disabling JavaScript by default might place {{project_name_short}} users in a small subset of the Tor Browser population. The JavaScript behavior of the broader population remains an open research question, so it is safest to avoid changes that might ''reduce'' the anonymity set. Keep in mind that fingerprinting potential also depends on Tor Browser's [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/9387 security] [[Tor_Browser#Security_Slider|slider]] settings. Ultimately, individuals are free to turn JavaScript on or off, depending on their [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/faq#TBBJavaScriptEnabled security, anonymity, and usability preferences].

=== NoScript Custom Setting Persistence ===

It is possible to save custom NoScript settings between browser restarts with a preference.<ref>This preference was first offered in alpha Tor Browser v8.5a2 but is now available in both the alpha and stable Tor Browser series.</ref> This preference is disabled by default, meaning custom NoScript settings will not persist across successive Tor Browser sessions.

==== Warning ====

This preference sacrifices privacy for convenience and is therefore <u>not</u> recommended. While frequently visited sites do not require the constant enabling/disabling of scripts across separate Tor Browser sessions, a number of anonymity risks are introduced:<ref>https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/27175</ref>

* <u>Disk hygiene:</u> Tor Browser is designed to prevent the persistent storage of history records and other on-disk information. This preference violates that design principle by allowing the storage of NoScript per-site permissions, thereby increasing the chance an adversary can extract valuable information from that data.
* <u>Long-term fingerprinting vectors:</u> Persistent per-site settings allow a website to profile Tor Browser users, particularly if [https://www.maketecheasier.com/first-party-isolation-firefox/ first-party isolation] is not enforced. For example, consider the negative anonymity impact of whitelisting Google or Facebook, since their advertisements and tracking widgets are ubiquitous.
* <u>Expert opinion:</u> Experienced Tor developers have confirmed that enabling this preference is dangerous and caution should be exercised. <ref name=caution>https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/27175#comment:12</ref>

==== Persistent NoScript Settings ====

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = <u>Note:</u>
# By defining custom settings in NoScript, this will override the current Tor Browser Security Slider setting.
# When <code>extensions.torbutton.noscript_persist</code> is set to <code>true</code>, these changes will persist across Tor Browser restarts.
}}

If this is acceptable, in the Tor Browser address bar:

* <code><i>"Type"</i> about:config</code> &rarr; <code><i>"Press"</i> enter</code> &rarr; <code><i>"Choose"</i> I accept the risk!</code> &rarr; <code><i>"Type"</i> extensions.torbutton.noscript_persist</code> &rarr; <code><i>"Toggle"</i> to true</code><ref>https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-85a2</ref>

This preference will be overridden and all custom per-site settings lost if:

* The security slider setting is changed afterward; <ref name=caution />
* <code>extensions.torbutton.noscript_persist</code> is set to <code>false</code> again, <ref>The default Tor Browser setting.</ref> since NoScript settings are reset after Tor Browser syncs with the Security Slider position.

== Non-default Add-ons ==

As Tor Browser is based on Firefox, any browser add-on compatible with Firefox can also be installed in Tor Browser. In this context, add-ons are the collective name given to extensions, themes, and plugins: <ref name=plugins>https://tb-manual.torproject.org/plugins/</ref>

* Extensions add new features to Firefox or modify existing ones, such as video downloaders, ad blockers, and more.
* Themes change the appearance of the browser, including buttons, menus, and the background image.
* [[Browser Plugins|Browser plugins]] add support for Internet content and often include patented formats like Flash and Silverlight, which are used for video, audio, online games, and more.<ref>https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/find-and-install-add-ons-add-features-to-firefox</ref>

=== Non-default Add-on Risks ===

The Tor Project explicitly warns against using non-default add-ons with Tor Browser: <ref name=plugins />

<blockquote>However, the only add-ons that have been tested for use with Tor Browser are those included by default. Installing any other browser add-ons may break functionality in Tor Browser or cause more serious problems that affect your privacy and security. It is strongly discouraged to install additional add-ons, and the Tor Project will not offer support for these configurations.

...

Video websites, such as Vimeo, make use of the Flash Player plugin to display video content. Unfortunately, this software operates independently of Tor Browser and cannot easily be made to obey Tor Browser’s proxy settings. It can therefore reveal your real location and IP address to the website operators or to an outside observer. For this reason, Flash is disabled by default in Tor Browser, and enabling it is not recommended.</blockquote>

=== Recommendations ===

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png|40px]]
| text    = '''Warning:''' For the safest Tor Browser experience, it is recommended to avoid Java, JavaScript, Flash, themes, browser plugins, and other non-default add-ons.
}}

The problem with non-default add-ons is that they often contain [[non-free]] software, which can lead to the linkage of activities conducted under one pseudonym. They also worsen fingerprinting and introduce attack vectors in the form of remote exploits.

This advice holds true even though {{project_name_short}} is configured to prevent these applications (along with malware) from leaking the real external IP address, even if they are misconfigured (see [[Features]]). Before installing non-default add-ons, consider alternatives such as HTML5 or online media converters. <ref>For example, most [https://www.youtube.com/supported_browsers videos] can be viewed in HTML5, which Tor Browser supports and prefers.</ref>

Torbutton has been moved from the URL bar and neither appears on the <code>about:addons</code> page. Other changes include the New Identity function shifting to the URL bar and the New Tor Circuit function being accessible via the hamburger menu. ... No functionality has been lost -- Torbutton's functions in Tor Browser behavior have [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/10760 simply moved into direct Firefox patches].</blockquote>
}}

Tor alone is not enough to protect anonymity and privacy while browsing the Internet. All modern web browsers support [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript JavaScript], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash Adobe Flash], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie cookies], and other features that are capable of defeating the anonymity <ref>[[Tips_on_Remaining_Anonymous#Study:_Anonymity_and_Pseudonymity_are_not_the_same]]</ref> provided by the Tor network.

In Tor Browser, these features are managed within the browser itself, as it is a [https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-browser.git modified (patched) version of Firefox]. It contains direct patches (based on the former [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/torbutton/ Torbutton extension]) that address application-level security and privacy concerns in Firefox. This means many types of active content are disabled. <ref>https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/torbutton/torbutton-faq.html.en</ref>

It is recommended to learn more about [[Fingerprint|Fingerprinting]] and [[Data Collection Techniques]] to better understand potential threats. Advanced users can also review detailed information about the former Torbutton design and its various functions [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#Torbutton_Design|here]].

== New Identity Function ==
[[File:Newidentityicon.png|thumb|New Identity Broom Symbol]]

There are two ways to get a new identity in Tor Browser. Choose one.

* '''A)''' <u>[[#Restart_Tor_Browser|Restart Tor Browser]] Method:</u> Simply close all Tor Browser windows and restart Tor Browser. <u>Or,</u>
* '''B)''' <u>New Identity Button Method:</u> Use the Tor Browser "New Identity" button. It clears the browser state, closes all browser tabs, and obtains a fresh Tor circuit for future requests. <ref>
* The "New Identity" button sends the protocol command "signal newnym" to Tor's <code>ControlPort</code>.
** Further, "signal newnym" does not interfere with long-lived connections such as an SSH or IRC connection originating from other applications.
* https://blog.torproject.org/torbutton-141-released
* [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/3455 Tor Browser's tab isolation by socks user name] should result in using new socks user names and therefore in using new circuits.
* While there is no Tor running inside {{project_name_workstation_short}}, this is still possible. [[Dev/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor|anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor]] redirects the connection to {{project_name_gateway_short}}, where [[onion-grater|onion-grater (user documentation)]] ([[Dev/onion-grater|onion-grater (developer documentation)]]) is running, forwarding it to Tor.

Sometimes Tor only replaces the middle relay while using the same Tor exit relay; this is by design and the Tor default. 

In [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_long}}]], the safest option when performing sensitive activities is using a {{project_name_workstation_long}} [[Qubes/Disposables|Disposable]]. To completely separate distinct activities, shut down the Disposable and create a new one between sessions.

Please read [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#New_Tor_Circuit_Design|New Tor Circuit Design]] and the [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#New_Identity_Design|New Identity Design]] to learn more about this option and its limitations. It is also recommended to read about [[Stream Isolation]] for further background information and even stronger isolation features.

The "New Tor Circuit for this Site" feature creates a new circuit for the <i>current</i> Tor Browser tab, including other open tabs or windows from the same website. <ref>https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/9442</ref> If it is necessary to separate contextual identities, it is always safer to close and then [[#Restart_Tor_Browser|Restart Tor Browser]].

There are several potential use cases for this feature: <ref>https://tails.boum.org/doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser/index.en.html</ref>

* The Tor exit relay is located in a country that negatively affects the presentation of the website due to language localization.
* The site is censored due to the current Tor exit relay in use (caused by Tor IP address blacklisting).
* To bypass Google [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA CAPTCHA] or [https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/ reCAPTCHA] systems protecting sites from abuse if these are showing unsolvable captchas or no captchas at all.
* Connections to websites become unresponsive or slow.
* To change the Tor exit relay IP address without losing all open tabs.

== Security Slider ==

Tor Browser includes a “Security Slider” that allows the disabling of certain web features that can be used to compromise security and anonymity. At present there are three levels: "Safest", "Safer" and "Standard". It is necessary to make a trade-off between security, usability and privacy. At the higher levels the slider will prevent some sites from working properly. <ref>https://tb-manual.torproject.org/security-settings/</ref> Note that as of Tor Browser release v8.5, the security slider function has shifted to the taskbar. <ref>https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-85</ref> <ref>https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/29825</ref>

==== Preventing SSLStrip Attacks ====

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = If clicking or pasting a download link, make sure it is <code>http'''s'''://</code>. The <code>s</code> in <code>http'''s'''://</code> stands for "secure".
}}

A common misconception is that a secure, green padlock and a <code>http'''s'''://</code> URL makes any download from that particular website secure. This is not the case because the website might be redirecting to <code>http</code>. In fact, an [https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/41988/how-does-sslstrip-work SSLstrip attack] might succeed if a link is pasted or typed into the address bar without the <code>https://</code> component (e.g. <code>www.torproject.org</code> instead of <code>https://www.torproject.org</code>) -- the reason is a padlock is not visible; it just appears empty. <ref>And that website does not:

* Use [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)]. See also: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/91092/how-does-bypassing-hsts-with-sslstrip-work-exactly. Without HSTS, sites with non-encrypted resources or sub-domains are vulnerable to SSLstrip.
* Have [https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/https-only-prefs HTTPS-Only Mode] enabled.
* Use [https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2012/11/01/preloading-hsts/ HSTS preloading].
* Use [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning HTTP Public Key Pinning]. See also: https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2016/03/22/secure-websites-shun-http-public-key-pinning.html. HPKP limits trust to a handful of Certificate Authorities, but is not used by many websites due to the risk of site breakage if keys are not managed vigilantly.
</ref>

To avoid this risk and similar threats, <u>always explicitly type or paste <code>https://</code> in the URL / address bar</u>. The SSL certificate button or padlock will not appear, but that is nothing to be concerned about. Unfortunately, few people follow this sage advice; instead most mistakenly believe pasting or typing www.torproject.org into the address bar is safe.

==== Other Precautions ====

For improved safety when downloading files or installing software, follow the advice below.

{| class="wikitable"
|+ ''Software and File Download Advice''
|-
! '''Category'''
! '''Recommendations'''
|-

! File Source and Verification
|
* If files are already available in repositories, then prefer mechanisms which simplify and automate software upgrades and installations (like APT functions), rather than download Internet resources. <br />
* Avoid installing unsigned software and always [[Verifying_Software_Signatures|verify key fingerprints and digital signatures of signed software]] from the Internet, <i>before</i> importing keys or completing installations; see {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=Install_Software#Best_Practices
|text=Installing Software Best Practices
}}.
|-

! [[Multiple Whonix-Workstation|Multiple {{project_name_workstation_short}}]]
| Consider using [[Multiple Whonix-Workstation|Multiple {{project_name_workstation_short}}]] when downloading and installing additional software. It is safer to compartmentalize discrete activities and minimize the threat of misbehaving applications.
|-

! Onion Service Downloads
| Files should be downloaded from [[Onion_Services|Onion Services]] (via <i>.onion</i> addresses) whenever possible. Onion service downloads improve security for several reasons: <br />
* The connection is encrypted end-to-end (with PFS). <br />
* It is difficult for network adversaries to: <br />
** Target specific individuals. <br />
** Determine where someone is connecting to/from.

=== Navigating Tor Browser Downloads ===

For those who regularly download Internet files, Tor Browser's default download folder is inconvenient. For example, if the sample image below was downloaded with Tor Browser, the download path is <code>/home/user/.tb/tor-browser/Browser/Downloads</code> by default. It is time-consuming to navigate to this folder so far down the directory tree.

'''Figure:''' ''Default Tor Browser Download Folder''

[[File:tbbd.png]]

To make things simpler, the following steps change Tor Browser preferences so files are saved directly inside <code>/home/user/Downloads</code>.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Navigate to Tor Browser preferences.

Choose one of the following three methods:

* <code>Click the "hamburger" symbol</code> &rarr; <code>Click Preferences</code>
* <code>Navigate to the <u>E</u>dit menu</code> &rarr; <code>click Preferences</code> &rarr; <code>click General tab</code>
* Enter <code>about:preferences</code> in the Tor Browser address bar.

'''Figure:''' ''Tor Browser Preferences''

[[File:tbbd6.png]]

'''2.''' Select the <code>Sa<u>v</u>e files to</code> download option.

'''Figure:''' ''Custom Download Path Option''

'''3.''' Change the default download folder location.

It is recommended to set <code>/home/user/Downloads</code> as the custom path.

== Prioritize Onion Connections ==

The release of Tor Browser v9.5 provides a new Onion Location function: <ref>https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-95</ref>

<blockquote>Website publishers now can advertise their onion service to Tor users by adding an HTTP header. When visiting a website that has both an .onion address and Onion Location enabled via Tor Browser, users will be prompted about the onion service version of the site and will be asked to opt-in to upgrade to the onion service on their first use.</blockquote>

This feature has been implemented across the entire <code>whonix.org</code> ecosystem, including the homepage, wiki, forums, phabricator and repository. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/onion-forum-site-redirects-to-clearnet/197</ref>

'''Figure:''' ''Onion Location Indicator for {{project_name_short}} Forums''

[[File:Whonixonionnotification.png|border]]

Once the "Always Prioritize Onions" option is set in Tor Browser, the relevant onion resource will always be preferred in the future. If you want to only upgrade to the onion resource one time, click "Not Now" and then press the "Onion Available" button one more time. This browser feature is located in <code>about:preferences#privacy</code> and can be changed at any time. <ref>
The Tor Project server side Onion Location feature is documented [https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-browser-spec.git/tree/proposals/100-onion-location-header.txt here].
</ref>

Security impact: none. <ref>Onion location header is a server side feature. Not a client side feature.

Quote [https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-browser-spec.git/tree/proposals/100-onion-location-header.txt Onion redirects using Onion-Location HTTP header]:

<blockquote>3. Drawbacks

3.1. No security/performance benefits

   While we could come up with onion redirection proposals that provide
   security and performance benefits, this proposal does not actually provide
   any of those.

   As a matter of fact, the security remains the same as connecting to normal
   websites, since for this proposal to work we need to trust their HTTP headers,
   and the user might have already provided identifying information
   (e.g. cookies) to the website. The performance is worse than connecting to a
   normal website, since Tor first needs to connect to the website, get its
   headers, and then finally connect to the onion.

   Still _all_ the website approaches mentioned in the "Motivation" section
   suffer from the above drawbacks, and sysadmins still come up with ad-hoc
   ways to inform users about their onions. So this simple proposal will still
   help those websites and also pave the way forward for future auto-redirect
techniques.</blockquote></ref>

For security improvement it might help to force connections to onions for websites that are reachable over clearnet and onion. This is currently only documented for [[Forcing .onion on Project]] but [[Unsupported|undocumented]] for arbitrary websites. Doing so would be possible as per [[Self_Support_First_Policy|Self Support First Policy]].

== Onion Client Authorization ==
There are two options to setup Onion Service Client Authentication. Choose <u>either</u> option '''A)''' <u>or</u> '''B)'''.

* '''A)''' [[Tor_Browser#Onion_Client_Authorization|Tor Browser Onion Client Authorization]], see below. <u>Or</u>,
* '''B)''' [[Onion_Services#Onion_Service_Authentication_Client_Setup|Onion Service Client Authentication setup on {{project_name_gateway_long}}]].

These options should never be combined for the same onion service.

'''Figure:''' ''Tor Browser Onion Client Authorization'' <ref>
* https://tb-manual.torproject.org/onion-services/
* https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-95
</ref>

[[File:Client-auth.png|border|800]]

Before Tor Browser Onion Client Authorization in {{project_name_short}} can be used, in other words, before private keys can be pasted into Tor Browser's Onion Client Authorization popup, an additional configuration step must be applied on {{project_name_gateway_short}}.

Tor Browser Onion Client Authorization requires additional Tor control protocol access. A [[{{project_name_gateway_short}}|{{project_name_gateway_short}}]] configuration change is therefore necessary for full functionality; see instructions below.

This is not enabled by default as this is a potential cross VM linking identifier in context of using [[Multiple Whonix-Workstation]]. When one {{project_name_workstation_short}} would login to an authenticated onion v3 services, this would login potential other {{project_name_workstation_short}} too. In any case, [[About|{{project_name_short}}]] is the safest choice for running it.

<ref>
* https://github.com/Whonix/onion-grater/blob/master/usr/share/doc/onion-grater-merger/examples/40_onion_authentication.yml
* This was successfully tested with Tor Browser version <code>11.0.3</code> and <code>11.5a1</code>.

}}

'''2.''' [[#Restart_Tor_Browser|Restart Tor Browser]] in [[Whonix-Workstation]].

'''3.''' Information.

Before proceeding, two things are required:

* '''A)''' The onion domain name, <u>and</u>
* '''B)''' The onion client authorization private key.

'''4.''' Learn how a client authorization private key looks.

Sample onion client authorization private key.

NOTE: The user must not use the following private key because it is only an example and will not work.

<pre>

</pre>

'''5.''' Open the onion service link in Tor Browser in {{project_name_workstation_short}}.

'''6.''' Get the onion client authorization private key from the onion service host.

The onion client authorization private key can only be provided by the onion service administrator.

'''8.''' Use Tor Browser Onion Client Authorization normally.

'''9.''' Done.

Tor Browser Onion Client Authorization setup is complete.
}}

Troubleshooting:

# Consider to always check the <code>Remember this key</code> option. In the experience of the author, this works more reliable.
# Make sure regular torified internet connections are functional.
# Make sure regular connections to unauthenticated onions service are functional.
# When setting up your own onion service:

* Exercise setting up the following outside of {{project_name_short}} first before attempting to replicate the same inside of {{project_name_short}} for simplicity. See also [[unspecific]].
* Exercise setting up a unauthenticated onion service first before attempting setting up an authenticated onion service.
* Exercise authenticated onion service but first attempt to use it without using Tor Browser's Onion Client Authorization feature. Try using it using Tor on the command line first.
* Only then attempt the same using an authenticated onion service in combination with Tor Browser's Onion Client Authorization feature.

== Browser Language ==
In 2021, the stable and experimental Tor Browser binaries with additional language packs support 34 languages. Recent additions include: Catalan, Irish, Indonesian, Icelandic, Norwegian, Danish, Hebrew, Swedish, Traditional Chinese, Macedonian and Romanian. <ref>https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-80</ref> <ref>https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-90</ref> <ref>https://www.torproject.org/download/languages/</ref> For instructions on changing the Tor Browser interface to a language other than English, see [[Language#Tor_Browser|Tor Browser Language]]. <ref>Language packs might be another fingerprinting vector, but this issue requires further investigation.</ref>

== Local Connections ==

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Web HTTP(S)/SOCKS proxies have different instructions and will not work with these steps, see [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#Change_Proxy_Settings|Tor Browser Proxy Configuration]].
}}

Sometimes it is necessary to access the local application interface on <code>127.0.0.1</code> in order to run specific applications like I2P. <ref>Since it uses predetermined ports on the localhost.</ref> Due to potential fingerprinting and information leakage risks, this behavior is no longer possible in Tor Browser unless an exception is configured. <ref>https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/10419</ref> <ref>https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/11493</ref>

To configure an exception for local connections in Tor Browser: <ref>Alternatively it is possible to  [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#Remove_Proxy_Settings|remove Tor Browser's proxy settings]], but this method is still vulnerable to the same fingerprinting issues as configuring an exception. There are also other factors which will worsen the user's fingerprint, such as the breaking of both stream isolation and the tab isolation by socks user name in Tor Browser.</ref>

URL bar &rarr; Type: <code>about:config</code> &rarr; Press <code>Enter</code> key &rarr;  search for and modify <code>network.proxy.no_proxies_on</code> &rarr; write addresses separated by comma: <code>localhost, 127.0.0.1</code> &rarr; <code>click "Save"</code>

The configured exception means a small trade-off in privacy, but it is much safer than using another browser (see [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#Local_Connections_Exception_Threat_Analysis|Local Connections Exception Threat Analysis]]).

=== Recommendations ===

For better anonymity:

* Browse with JavaScript disabled in Tor Browser and enable it only when needed. Disabled JavaScript mitigates these browser fingerprinting issues completely.
* Set passwords for web interfaces listening on the localhost.
* Run sensitive daemons with local WebGUIs on a separate, dedicated {{project_name_workstation_short}} and virtual network instance. TODO: expand or link how to do that

A website is unreachable? Shows access denied or a captcha? See [[Geo-blocking]].

== AppArmor Confinement ==
[[AppArmor|AppArmor]] can help to protect the user's system and data. It confines programs according to a set of rules that specify what files a given program can access, and with what privileges. This also provides some protection against zero-day attacks and exploits via unknown application flaws. An AppArmor profile for Tor Browser is by default nowadays in {{project_name_short}}.

Since package <code>apparmor-profile-torbrowser</code> AppArmor is applied, Tor Browser can only read and write to a limited number of folders. Permission denied errors are quite common, for example when trying to download files directly to the <code>~/home</code> folder.

The workaround for AppArmor denied errors is saving files from Tor Browser to the <code>~/Downloads</code> folder that is located within the <code>~/home</code> folder. In order to upload files with Tor Browser, first copy them to that folder.

== Harden Tor Browser ==

Anonymity and safety can be materially improved via: AppArmor, Tor Browser settings, sandboxing, multiple Tor Browser instances, and operation of multiple {{project_name_workstation_short}} or {{project_name_workstation_short}} Disposables ([[Qubes|{{q_project_name_short}}]]).

Tor Browser provides reasonable security in its stock configuration. However, mitigating the risk of Tor Browser security breaches makes sense, because it is an untrusted application with a huge attack surface; it is frequently  attacked successfully in the wild by adversaries.

{{Anchor|Hardening}}
! Firejail Confinement
| Firejail can be used as an alternative sandboxing measure to restrict the Tor Browser process. The Tor Browser Starter by {{project_name_short}} developers in {{project_name_short}} testers repository includes a “hardening” option that permits certain features to be enabled that on the upside increase security, but on the downside might decrease anonymity. <ref>[https://github.com/Kicksecure/tb-starter/blob/master/usr/bin/torbrowser tb-starter] will enable the Tor Browser Firejail profile. [https://forums.whonix.org/t/automatically-firejailing-tor-browser/4767/21 development discussion]
</ref>

It is necessary to make a trade-off between security, usability and privacy. With “hardening” enabled, certain website features might be non-functional or Tor Browser may no longer start after an upgrade. Also, the [[Fingerprint#Visited_Websites|fingerprint]] seen by websites ('web fingerprint') might reveal subtle differences between Tor Browser instances that have enabled this feature compared to the default configuration. The population of Linux Tor Browser users who regularly utilize Firejail is likely to be tiny. At the time of writing (2019) there were no reports confirming a detectable fingerprint, but there is also no known research being undertaken in this area. <ref>The Tor Project does not currently provide a hardened / sandboxed Tor Browser build, see: [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/25540 Stop building and distributing sandboxed-tor-browser binaries].</ref> <ref>[https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TorBrowser/Sandbox/Linux Linux Sandboxed Tor Browser Documentation]: <blockquote>WARNING: This project is no longer maintained. DO NOT EXPECT ANY FURTHER FIXES, INCLUDING SECURITY AND STOP USING THIS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

WARNING: There are several unresolved issues that affect security and fingerprinting. Do not assume that this is perfect, merely "an improvement over nothing".

! Multiple Tor Browser Instances and {{project_name_workstation_short}}
|
* <u>Multiple Tor Browser Instances</u>: To better separate different contextual identities, consider starting [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#Multiple_Tor_Browser_Instances_and_Workstations|multiple Tor Browser instances]] and running them through different SocksPorts. This method is less secure than the method outlined below.
* <u>Multiple {{project_name_workstation_short}}</u>: For tasks requiring different identities and/or additional software, it is recommended to compartmentalize activities and use [[Multiple Whonix-Workstation|two or more {{project_name_workstation_short}} VMs]]. In this way, an exploit in Tor Browser in one {{project_name_workstation_short}} cannot simultaneously read the individual's identity in another VM (for example, an IRC account). <ref>This does not protect against the sudden loss of networking, which could reveal to the attacker that two activities / accounts suddenly going off-line are probably related.</ref> This method is less secure than using a {{project_name_workstation_short}} Disposable with Tor Browser (see below).
|-

! Sandboxing and Disposables
|
* <u>Sandboxing</u>: The Tor Project's official sandboxed Tor Browser is compatible with {{project_name_short}} 14 and later releases, however it is no longer recommended since The Tor Project has officially abandoned its development. <ref>https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/25540</ref>
* <u>{{project_name_workstation_short}} Disposables</u>: One of the safest configurations is to assume future compromise and run all instances of Tor Browser in an uncustomized {{project_name_workstation_short}} [[Qubes/Disposables|Disposable]] in [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_short}}]]. This configuration creates fresh {{project_name_workstation_short}} and Tor Browser instances for discrete Internet activities, while ensuring that previous, potentially compromised versions of both are destroyed. <ref>This does not protect against potential infection of dom0 or the {{project_name_workstation_short}} Disposable Template by advanced adversaries. Traces of activity may also be left on storage media or in RAM.</ref>
|-

! Tor Browser Series and Settings

'''Warning:''' Never continue to use an outdated version of Tor Browser. This can degrade anonymity and may even lead to compromise of the {{project_name_workstation_short}} VM. <ref>https://tb-manual.torproject.org/updating/</ref>

== Tor Browser Downloader by {{project_name_short}} ==
{{Anchor|Downloader}}
=== tb-updater Introduction ===
{{Anchor|Downloader}}

Tor Browser Downloader by {{project_name_short}} is a usability tool designed to automate the process of downloading and installing the Tor Browser inside {{project_name_workstation_short}}. It simplifies installation for both [[Non-Qubes-Whonix]] and [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_short}}]] users by handling retrieval, signature verification, and extraction of the latest stable or alpha versions of Tor Browser.

'''Important:''' This tool is not an updater. It is incapable of preserving user data such as bookmarks, passwords, or other browser profile settings. For retaining user data across Tor Browser upgrades, use the [[#Tor_Browser_Internal_Updater|Tor Browser Internal Updater]] instead.

The tool supports:

* Initial installation of Tor Browser.
* Re-installation of Tor Browser in case of corruption or failed updates.
* Selecting between stable and alpha versions.
* Optionally downloading over <code>.onion</code>.

For security, the tool verifies digital signatures and highlights potential downgrade or freeze attacks before proceeding with installation.

The next sections detail how to launch the downloader, perform installation, and configure behavior based on user preferences and threat models.

=== Installation Process ===
'''Note:''' {{Code2|Tor Browser Downloader ({{project_name_short}})}} is really just a downloader, not an updater. This means it is incapable of retaining user data such as bookmarks and passwords. In order to preserve data, use the [[#Tor_Browser_Internal_Updater|Internal Updater]] method instead.

To use {{Code2|Tor Browser Downloader ({{project_name_short}})}}, follow these instructions in {{project_name_workstation_short}}.

{{Box|text=

'''5.''' Check the Tor Browser signature was correctly verified.

Once the download has finished, the downloader will provide verification (or not) of the cryptographic signature associated with the Tor Browser binary, highlighting the key used to sign it and the date. The downloader will then ask for confirmation to install the package: see [[#Installation_Confirmation_Notification|Installation Confirmation Notification]] for steps on identifying a possible targeted attack.

'''8.''' Done.

The process has been completed.
}}

=== Download Confirmation Notification ===

This step is designed to keep {{project_name_short}} users safe, since at present there is no reliable and secure way for a program to determine the latest stable version of Tor Browser with reasonable certainty. <ref>[https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/14383 Finalize RecommendedTBBVersions format]</ref> <ref>[https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/13065 Counter downgrade / stale mirror attacks on RecommendedTBBVersions - sign / verify tbb versions file]</ref> When the version format changes, the automated parser of version information could falsely suggest:

* An earlier stable version that is still considered secure.
* An alpha series release.
* A beta Tor Browser build.
* A release candidate or nightly Tor Browser build.

Alternatively, one might be targeted by a denial of service, indefinite freeze or rollback (downgrade) attack. <ref>For a definition of these attacks, see the [https://theupdateframework.io/security/ threat model] of [https://theupdateframework.io/ TUF] ([https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf The Update Framework]).</ref>
<ref>Adversaries capable of breaking [[SSL]] could mount these attacks by replacing [https://aus1.torproject.org/torbrowser/update_3/release/download-linux-x86_64.json RecommendedTBBVersions] with invalid, frozen or outdated version information.</ref>

To counter these threats, user intelligence is utilized as a sanity check. The Download Confirmation Notification provides a way to detect such situations and abort the procedure. In this instance, it is recommended to rotate the Tor circuits and attempt the download process again.

Version numbers that are visible under {{Code2|Online versions}} come from an online resource. The Tor Browser [https://aus1.torproject.org/torbrowser/update_3/release/download-linux-x86_64.json RecommendedTBBVersions] versions file is provided by The Tor Project, and is parsed by {{project_name_short}} Tor Browser Downloader. The {{project_name_short}} downloader will indicate that no upgrade is required if the installed Tor Browser version matches the up-to-date online version.

TODO: expand.

=== Installation Confirmation Notification ===

This step is also designed to protect users, since at present there is no reliable and secure way for a program to determine (with reasonable certainty) if the Tor Browser download was targeted by an indefinite freeze or rollback attack. <ref>Unfortunately, Tor Browser signatures do not yet provide expiration dates in a manner similar to Debian's [https://blog.ganneff.de/2008/09/valid-until-field-in-release-f.html valid-until] field.</ref> <ref>Rollback attacks are possible because if a computer's clock is wrong, there is no solid basis for comparison.</ref>

When verifying cryptographic signatures, several important aspects must be considered:

* The signature should be made by a trusted key.
* Trusted keys will have signed other files in the past. It is also necessary to check if the right file was received, and not just any file that was signed by a trusted key.
* Even if the correct file type is received, <ref>
That is, a browser and not a messenger or other application.
</ref> it is necessary to check it has a <i>current</i> signature attached and not a historical one. This step counters the threat of indefinite freeze and rollback attacks.

By the time the Installation Confirmation Notification is visible, the verification of the signature (and hash) will have already succeeded. However, the signature creation dates in the figure below must be carefully examined to confirm that an indefinite freeze or downgrade attack did not occur.

<u>Previous Signature Creation Date</u>: When Tor Browser was previously installed by tb-updater, the creation date of the accompanying signature that signed Tor Browser will have been stored. The {{Code2|Previous Signature Creation Date}} field displays that date.<br />
<u>Last Signature Creation Date</u>: This field displays the date of signature creation for the downloaded file.

=== Tor Browser Downloader (by {{project_name_short}} developers) Issues downloading Tor Browser ===
'''Figure:''' ''Tor Browser Downloader (by {{project_name_short}} developers) failed to download Tor Browser''

[[File:tb_failed_to_install.png]]

Possible reasons:

* Internet connectivity issue.
* The download server is down.
* File size exceeded (endless data attack triggered).
* Tor Browser Downloader (by {{project_name_short}} developers) has been broken due to upstream changes.

Recommendations:

* If this happened during an APT upgrade, this will not fix itself. In that case, the user must manually take steps to [[#Update Tor Browser|Update Tor Browser]].
* Wait a bit and try again later.
** If the error persists it probably won't solve itself before the next update.
* Check News: [[Stay Tuned]]
* Last resort, [[#Tor_Browser_Manual_Update|Tor Browser  manual updates]].

=== Expired Key ===
Tor Browser Downloader (by {{project_name_short}} Developers):

* Can only automate what is supported by upstream, The Tor Project anyhow.
* Is fully optional. A usability feature. It does not do anything that could not also be done manually by the user.

First, exercise: [https://support.torproject.org/tbb/how-to-verify-signature/ verify Tor Browser according to upstream instructions]. [[Unspecific|Unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]]. If that is not possible, if that includes "key expired" then nothing that can be fixed in {{project_name_short}}.

== Tor Browser Internal Updater ==
{{Anchor|Internal Updater}}
Tor Browser upgrades are possible from within the browser using Tor Browser Internal Updater (by <code>The Tor Project</code>). <ref>
https://blog.torproject.org/tor-browser-50-released

<blockquote>Starting with this release, Tor Browser will now also download and apply upgrades in the background, to ensure that users upgrade quicker and with less interaction. This behavior is governed by the about:config pref app.update.auto, but we do not recommend disabling it unless you really know what you're doing.</blockquote>
</ref> When a new Tor Browser version is available but the browser has not completed an automatic upgrade in the background (the default), a warning prompt appears recommending a manual upgrade. To upgrade, either:

* <code>Enter about:preferences in the URL bar</code> &rarr; <code>Scroll down to "Tor Browser Updates"</code> &rarr; <code>Click "<u>C</u>heck for updates"</code>; or
* <code>Open Menu</code> &rarr; <code>Help</code> &rarr; <code>About Tor Browser</code> &rarr; <code>Wait until the download finishes</code> &rarr; <code>Restart to update Tor Browser</code>

'''Figure:''' ''Tor Browser Update Notification''

[[File:TBBupdater.png|600px]]

Using Tor Browser Internal Updater automatically makes use of its built-in [[Verifying Software Signatures|software signatures verification]] feature. <ref>
The internal updater process involves several automatic steps ([https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-951/#comment-288479 source]):

<blockquote>1) Tor Browser contacts server "A" and asks if an update is available. If there is an update, then server "A" responds with metadata about the update file (a URL for that file, the size of the file, the SHA512 hash of the file).
2) Tor Browser follows the provided URL and connects to server "B" and downloads the file
3) Tor Browser verifies the size of the file and sha512 hash of the file are as expected
4) Tor Browser verifies the cryptographic signature on the file. Tor Browser has two public keys hard-coded for which signatures on updates will be accepted.

The update is installed after all checks pass.</blockquote>
</ref> Manual software resignation verification is not required when using this update method.

== Tor Browser Manual Update ==

}}

Modern Tor Browser releases are generally easy to install and update on well-supported platforms like {{project_name_short}}, leading most to have a comfortable and reliable experience over long periods. However, if/when Tor Browser "breaks", some might find it difficult to perform a manual installation. <ref>Before the introduction of [[Tor_Browser#Tor_Browser_Internal_Updater|Tor Browser's internal updater]], manual installation was a difficult task which required the renaming (or deletion) of the old Tor Browser folder before the new version was extracted. If Tor Browser functions "under the hood" are a mystery, then unsurprisingly problems are often encountered during manual installation, particularly on the host.</ref>

=== {{project_name_short}} Bugs ===
Sometimes [[Tor_Browser#Tor_Browser_Downloader_by_Whonix|Tor Browser Downloader]] inside {{project_name_workstation_short}} breaks because torproject.org changes the way Tor Browser can be downloaded or verified. This program is maintained by the [[Contributors|{{project_name_short}} contributors]] and The Tor Project is not responsible for necessary fixes. Generally, [https://forums.whonix.org/c/news {{project_name_short}} news] will be published within a few days with working instructions on how to fix the problem. If this does not happen, then {{project_name_short}} developers are unaware of the issue.

Any bugs should be discussed in the {{project_name_short}} [https://forums.{{project_clearnet}} User Help Forum]. To date, no bugs were ever discovered in Tor Browser that were directly related to {{project_name_short}} code and which might cause serious problems such as website pages failing to load.

=== Prerequisite Knowledge ===
The [[Tor_Browser/Manual_Download|manual Tor Browser download]] procedure assumes essential knowledge of:

* <u>Software Verification</u>: For better security, the Tor Browser package should be verified with GnuPG, using the associated file signature and Tor signing keys (relevant links are provided). <ref>
{{project_name_short}} is not a standalone package, but a complete operating system. {{project_name_short}} has a small team, while torproject.org has a much larger community and dedicated, paid support staff. Therefore, {{project_name_short}} users are expected to learn Tor Browser essentials in the first instance.

* <u>Troubleshooting</u>: If Tor Browser problems occur in {{project_name_short}} such as webpages failing to resolve, then:
** The same tests should be performed on the host ({{non_q_project_name_short}}) or in a non-{{project_name_short}} VM ({{q_project_name_short}}); see [[Install Tor Browser Outside of Whonix|Non-{{project_name_short}} Tor Browser]]. This step helps to determine whether the problem is related to {{project_name_short}} or not.
** It is also sensible to search for the problem on [https://gitlab.torproject.org/search torproject.org's bug tracker] and report a bug upstream if it has not been notified yet. In that case, when upstream (TPO) fixes the issue, the issue will most likely also get fixed in {{project_name_short}}.

= Unsafe Tor Browser Habits =
It is important to develop a set of safe habits when communicating, browsing or downloading with Tor Browser. Even the world's premier anonymity software cannot protect people if they shoot themselves in the foot.

The following is an inexhaustive list of <u>un</u>safe behaviors. It is recommended to also read the {{project_name_short}} [[Tips_on_Remaining_Anonymous|Tips on Remaining Anonymous]] entry, along with [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/documentation.html.en Tor Project documentation] before using Tor Browser for serious activities necessitating anonymity.

[https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-90 New Release: Tor Browser 9.0]:

<blockquote>Tor Browser in its default mode is starting with a content window rounded to a multiple of 200px x 100px  to prevent fingerprinting the screen dimensions. The strategy here is to put all users in a couple of buckets to make it harder to single them out. That worked so far until users started to resize their windows (e.g. by maximizing them or going into fullscreen mode). Tor Browser 9 ships with a fingerprinting defense for those scenarios as well, which is called Letterboxing, a technique developed by Mozilla and presented earlier this year. It works by adding white margins to a browser window so that the window is as close as possible to the desired size while users are still in a couple of screen size buckets that prevent singling them out with the help of screen dimensions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I've been looking for how to fix some bad default settings in the {{project_name_short}} tor browser. Namely, they removed NoScript from the toolbar, so that the NoScript cannot be used as intended.</blockquote>

As noted in the [[#Tor Browser Bundle versus {{project_name_short}} Tor Browser|{{project_name_short}} Tor Browser Differences]] entry, {{project_name_short}} does <u>not</u>:

* Apply file system level changes to the Tor Browser folder. In other words, there are no modifications of any files inside Tor Browser's data folder. Files such as startup script, default settings and so on are untouched.
* Change Tor Browser's internal updater checking mechanism;
* Change or remove proxy settings by default; or

In fact, the NoScript URL bar change was a conscious decision by Tor developers which became part of a recent release: <ref>

Quote Tor Browser developer Nicolas Vigier ([https://gitlab.torproject.org/boklm @boklm]):

<blockquote>NoScript and HTTPS Everywhere are still present in the URL bar if you upgraded from an older version. They are not present if you did a new install with a recent version.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If you want to turn off javascript, then you can change the security level. There is also nothing preventing you from adding NoScript on the toolbar even if it is not there by default.</blockquote>

== Tor Browser Bundle versus {{project_name_short}} Tor Browser ==

The regular Tor Browser Bundle and {{project_name_short}} Tor Browser slightly differ. The reason is Tor Browser must be adjusted by {{project_name_short}} to work behind {{project_name_gateway_short}}.

The main {{project_name_short}} Tor Browser differences can be summarized as follows: <ref>
https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/19652
</ref>

* All changes are done through global environmental variable adjustments. <ref>
* [https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-welcome-page/blob/master/etc/profile.d/20_whonix-welcome-page.sh <code>/etc/profile.d/20_whonix-welcome-page.sh</code> which is symlinked to <code>/etc/X11/Xsession.d/20torbrowser</code>]

</ref>
* Despite environmental variable adjustments, the network and browser fingerprint remain the same.
* [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#tor-launcher|tor-launcher]] (Tor connection wizard) will not be shown in {{project_name_workstation_short}} Tor Browser. Instead, [[Anon Connection Wizard]] is available in {{project_name_gateway_short}}.
* The Tor Circuit View and Open Network Settings functions have been [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#Disabled_Tor_Browser_Functions|disabled]]. The former is [[unsupported]] for security reasons, <ref>This is so {{project_name_workstation_short}} does not have access to the information about which Tor middle relay or Tor entry guard or [[Bridges]] are in use. See also: [[Dev/onion-grater#Indicator_for_current_Circuit_Status_and_Exit_IP|Indicator for current Circuit Status and Exit IP]].</ref> while the latter would have no effect since Tor must be configured in {{project_name_gateway_short}}.
* The default landing page after Tor Browser starts is set to a local {{project_name_short}} resource through an environment variable. <ref>
* https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-welcome-page/blob/master/etc/profile.d/20_whonix-welcome-page.sh
* [https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-welcome-page/blob/master/usr/libexec/whonix-welcome-page/env_var.sh <code>/usr/libexec/whonix-welcome-page/env_var.sh</code>]
* The default Tor Browser Bundle uses <code>about:tor</code> as the landing page. See: https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/13835
</ref>

Tor does not get started by the {{Code2|[https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-launcher.git tor-launcher]}} Firefox add-on because the {{Code2|[https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/6009 TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH]}} environment variable has been set set to {{Code2|1}}.

* Change Tor Browser's [[#Tor_Browser_Internal_Updater|Internal Updater checking mechanism]];
* [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#Proxy_Settings|Change or remove proxy settings]] by default.

Changes are kept minimal and for integration purposes only. This is a deliberate design decision. Quote Tor Browser, advanced users, [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#Tor_Browser_Update:_Technical_Details|Tor Browser Update: Technical Details]]:

<blockquote>Therefore it would be unwise for a downstream Linux distribution such as Whonix to attempt to separate binaries and user data.</blockquote>

== Tor Browser Functionality on Different Platforms ==
{{mbox

No changes have been made in {{project_name_short}} code to prevent such a warning.
</ref>
}}

The reason is this comparison includes a host of platform-specific differences which confound the result. For example, a more valid comparison would examine the differences between:

* TBB in Debian (real Debian, not in Qubes) versus Tor Browser in [[Non-Qubes-Whonix|{{non_q_project_name_short}}]].
* TBB in a Qubes App Qube based on a Debian Template versus Tor Browser in [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_short}}]].

Similarly, these comparisons would be helpful in order to help with TBB (non-{{project_name_short}}) development:

* TBB in Debian (real Debian, not in Qubes) vs TBB in Windows.
* TBB in different Linux distributions.
* TBB in different Windows platforms.

'''Figure:''' ''Tor Browser "Your connection to Tor is not being managed by Tor Browser" Message''

[[File:Your_connection_to_Tor_is_not_being_managed_by_Tor_Browser.png]]

There is a related Tor Browser upstream bug: [https://forums.whonix.org/t/local-browser-homepage-for-tor-browser-in-whonix/347/117 Environment variable `TOR_DEFAULT_HOMEPAGE` is no longer honored when Tor Browser is restarted using its new identity button]

The information "Your connection to Tor is not being managed by Tor Browser" is true and expected. This simply means that Tor connection settings cannot be modified from within [[Whonix-Workstation]] using Tor Browser. The connection is managed by [[Whonix-Gateway]]. This is documented in chapter [[Tor_Browser#Tor_Browser_Bundle_versus_Whonix_Tor_Browser|Tor Browser Bundle versus Whonix Tor Browser]]. For information on how to configure Tor, see the dedicated wiki page about [[Tor]].

= Troubleshooting =
== Close Tor Browser ==

Sometimes the following error message appears when no Tor Browser window is open.

'''Figure:''' ''Running Tor Browser Instance''

[[File:Tor browser already running.png]]

<blockquote>Tor Browser is already running, but is not responding. To use Tor Browser, you must first close the existing Tor Browser process, restart your device, or use a different profile.</blockquote>

Most likely Tor Browser is still/already running in the background but without a visible desktop environment window due to an existing software bug.

To kill the Tor Browser process, run the following command.

{{CodeSelect|code=
pkill firefox.real
}}

See also: [[#Tor Browser Crash Errors|Tor Browser Crash Errors]].

== Restart Tor Browser ==
Simply close all Tor Browser windows and restart Tor Browser. This is in most cases sufficient for a Tor Browser restart.

In case of issues the user might want to:

* [[#Confirm Terminated Tor Browser|Confirm Terminated Tor Browser]]
* [[#Force Terminate Tor Browser|Force Terminate Tor Browser]]

== Confirm Terminated Tor Browser ==
While Tor Browser windows might have been closed, Tor Browser might still be running in the background due to a bug. To confirm that Tor Browser has really been terminated there are two options.

* A) <u>System reboot method:</u> This is the simplest method. By simply restarting the Whonix-Workstation it is guaranteed that Tor Browser will be terminated.
* B) <u>Manual process viewing method:</u>

{{CodeSelect|code=
pgrep firefox     
}}

Example output if still running:

Note: The process number (pid) will most likely be different.

<pre>
259109
</pre>

Example output if not running:

<pre>
zsh: exit 1     pgrep firefox
</pre>

See footnote for alternative command. <ref>
{{CodeSelect|code=
ps aux {{!}} grep firefox
}}
</ref>

== Force Terminate Tor Browser ==
To kill Tor Browser, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
killall firefox.real
}}

Example output if still running:

Note: This means "none".

<pre>
</pre>

Example output if not running:

<pre>

This process is useful to test whether or not there are any issues related to TBB with:

* downloading,
* digital software verification, or
* installation.
* Another benefit of installing TBB in this fashion is that if Tor Browser unexpectedly stops running in {{project_name_short}}, then Tor Browser can still be independently used to visit the {{project_name_short}} website for a solution to this issue.

If TBB fails to properly download, pass digital software signature verification or installation on the host operating system or from a non-{{project_name_short}} App Qube in Qubes, then Tor Browser inside {{project_name_short}} will similarly fail to work.

There are two options to install TBB outside of {{project_name_short}}.

* '''A)''' Using Tor Browser Downloader (by {{project_name_short}} developers).
** Refer to the [[Install_Tor_Browser_Outside_of_{{project_name_short}}|Install Non-{{project_name_short}} Tor Browser using Tor Browser Downloader (by {{project_name_short}} developers)]] chapter for TBB installation instructions on all platforms.
** The disadvantage of this method is that it will break in case there are TBB download or digital software verification issues. <ref>
Still very useful for comparison of TBB outside of {{project_name_short}} versus Tor Browser inside {{project_name_short}}.
</ref>
* '''B)''' Manually install Tor Browser.

This process is [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]].

# Navigate to https://www.torproject.org/download/ ([http://2gzyxa5ihm7nsggfxnu52rck2vv4rvmdlkiu3zzui5du4xyclen53wid.onion/download/ .onion]) website and download Tor Browser and the associated file signature (<code>.asc</code>).
# Read https://support.torproject.org/tbb/how-to-verify-signature/ ([http://rzuwtpc4wb3xdzrj3yeajsvm3fkq4vbeubm2tdxaqruzzzgs5dwemlad.onion/tbb/how-to-verify-signature/ .onion]) and learn how to perform digital software signature verification ("<code>gpg</code>"). Download and import the necessary keys.
# Perform digital software signature verification for the Tor Browser download.
# If the old version of Tor Browser is still open, close it.
# Extract Tor Browser: <code>Right-click on the downloaded archive</code> &rarr; <code>extract</code> &rarr; <code>extract archive here</code>
# The process is complete.
# Start Tor Browser.

For any issues during manual download, digital software verification and installation of TBB, the user should perform [[Reporting_Bugs#Generic_Bug_Reproduction|Generic Bug Reproduction]].

== Tor Browser Crash Errors ==
{{Anchor|Crash_Errors}}

Occasionally, Tor Browser might crash. Either:

* '''A)''' Browser freezes.
* '''B)''' No visible browser window.
* '''C)''' At browser startup. For example, after a new Tor Browser update is released, errors might occur upon launch. <ref>
https://forums.whonix.org/t/tor-browser-error-perhaps-from-9-0-1-update/8468
</ref> <ref>
The error is likely related to existing Tor bugs reported against [https://gitlab.torproject.org/search?scope=issues&search=incremental&state=opened (incremental)] [https://gitlab.torproject.org/search?scope=issues&search=update&state=opened updates].

ERROR: Tor Browser ended with non-zero (error) exit code!

Tor Browser was started with:

/home/user/.tb/tor-browser/Browser/start-tor-browser --allow-remote /usr/share/homepage/whonix-welcome-page/whonix.html

Tor Browser exited with code: 1

To see this for yourself, you could try:
Start Menu -> System -> Qterminal
Then run:

</pre>

Which situation describes your case best?

* '''A)''' 1) Happening inside VirtualBox? 2) Using Linux as host operating system? 3) Tor Browser crash issues happening recently since host kernel upgrade? If the answer to all 3 questions is "yes" then see {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=VirtualBox/Troubleshooting#Linux_Host_Kernel_versus_Tor_Browser_and_other_Crashes
|text=Linux Host Kernel versus Tor Browser and other Crashes
}}.
* '''B)''' Otherwise, see below.

Even though this is happening inside {{project_name_short}}, the cause is most often unrelated to {{project_name_short}} code. Tor Browser is developed by [https://www.torproject.org The Tor Project], which is an independent entity. This is the norm in Linux distributions. To learn more about such relationships see {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=Linux User Experience versus Commercial Operating Systems
|text=Linux User Experience versus Commercial Operating Systems
}}.

{{project_name_short}} does integration work to get Tor Browser into the platform. To use a simple analogy, {{project_name_short}} stays "on the outside". Very few internal modifications are made to Tor Browser as described in the [[Tor_Browser#Whonix_Tor_Browser_Differences|{{project_name_short}} Tor Browser Differences]] chapter.

Before attempting to resolve the issue, the user might want to consider to [[#Backup and Restore Browser Settings|Backup and Restore Browser Settings]] (or alternatively [[Backup VMs]]) if there are any browser bookmarks or settings the user would rather keep.

To remedy this kind of issue, there are three different promising approaches. Choose one.

* '''A)''' [[Factory Reset]]
* '''B)''' [[#Delete and Reinstall Tor Browser|Delete and Reinstall Tor Browser]]
* '''C)''' [[#Attempt to Debug the Issue|Attempt to Debug the Issue]]

=== Delete and Reinstall Tor Browser ===

If browser settings like bookmarks, saved passwords and so on are not too important, Tor Browser can be completely deleted and reinstalled. Tor Browser usually functions normally after this procedure. The easiest method is using [[Tor_Browser#Tor_Browser_Downloader_by_Whonix|Tor Browser Downloader by {{project_name_short}}]] for this process.

=== Attempt to Debug the Issue ===

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Debugging attempts are not guaranteed to work, but are encouraged to help fix outstanding issues.
}}

* During debug attempts, do not use <code>torbrowser</code> command (<code>/usr/bin/torbrowser</code> script) or the Tor Browser start menu entry because these are provided by {{project_name_short}} and are not the cause here.
* The Tor Project is responsible for errors that emerge when Tor Browser is started manually or in debug mode.
** Issues such as <code>Segmentation fault (core dumped)</code> are most likely caused by Tor Browser, not {{project_name_short}}.

'''A)''' Advanced users can try to start Tor Browser without the help of <code>/usr/bin/torbrowser</code> by {{project_name_short}}, thereby bypassing that part of {{project_name_short}} Tor Browser integration. Tor Browser resides in folder <code>~/.tb/tor-browser</code>. Therefore, Tor Browser can be launched in [[Tor_Browser#In_Debugging_Mode|Debugging Mode]], which is a Tor Browser (not {{project_name_short}}) feature. If that does not help...

'''B)''' Additionally, the whole <code>~/.tb/tor-browser</code> folder could be copied to a Debian <code>{{stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code> machine or better yet, a virtual machine. For better security, a virtual machine might even be non-networked before attempts are made to launch Tor Browser. This error is likely to be reproducible outside {{project_name_short}} and this step will provide confirmation.

'''1.''' [[Reporting_Bugs#Generic_Bug_Reproduction|Generic Bug Reproduction]] is unfortunately required.

'''2.''' Meaning, the issue is unfortunately required to be reproduced without any reference to {{project_name_short}}, without using {{project_name_short}}, outside of {{project_name_short}}. On Debian.

'''3.''' The whole <code>~/.tb/tor-browser</code> folder needs to be copied to a Debian <code>{{stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code> machine, ideally a VM.

'''4.''' The issue needs to be reproduced on Debian. Not {{project_name_short}}.

'''5.''' Report the bug to The Tor Project.

'''6.''' Please notify {{project_name_short}} forums about any outcomes.

Be aware the [https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/team Tor Bug Tracker] already has various, existing bug reports related to incremental updates via the Tor Browser internal updater. These are most likely related to Tor Browser launch failures:

* https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/29771
* https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/16028
* https://gitlab.torproject.org/search?scope=issues&search=incremental&state=opened
* https://gitlab.torproject.org/search?scope=issues&search=update&state=opened

=== Backup and Restore Browser Settings ===

Steps to perform a backup and restore of browser settings (like bookmarks) are currently [[Unsupported|undocumented]] in the {{project_name_short}} wiki. However, any online instructions for this process in Tor Browser or even Firefox should equally apply in {{project_name_short}}. The only difference is the {{project_name_short}} Tor Browser folder location: <code>~/.tb/tor-browser</code>.

== Why do I have White Bars around my Tor Browser Content? ==

Users who [[Screen#Full_Screen|ignore advice]] to (not) maximize/resize the Tor Browser window will now notice white borders surrounding the Tor Browser content: <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/is-anyone-having-white-bars-in-the-tbb-tor-browser-letterboxing/8345</ref>

<blockquote>Ever since 9 update I have had white bars at the bottom and top of my browser. Even with using the TBB on non-whonix I still have them. Am I the only one & am I exposed?</blockquote>

This is {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=Malware_and_Firmware_Trojans#Valid_Compromise_Indicators_versus_Invalid_Compromise_Indicators
|text=not an indicator of compromise
}}, but a new fingerprinting defense called [https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-90 Letterboxing]:

<blockquote>Tor Browser in its default mode is starting with a content window rounded to a multiple of 200px x 100px to prevent fingerprinting the screen dimensions. The strategy here is to put all users in a couple of buckets to make it harder to single them out. That worked so far until users started to resize their windows (e.g. by maximizing them or going into fullscreen mode). Tor Browser 9 ships with a fingerprinting defense for those scenarios as well, which is called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterboxing_(filming) Letterboxing], a technique developed by Mozilla and presented [https://www.zdnet.com/article/firefox-to-add-tor-browser-anti-fingerprinting-technique-called-letterboxing/ earlier this year]. It works by adding white margins to a browser window so that the window is as close as possible to the desired size while users are still in a couple of screen size buckets that prevent singling them out with the help of screen dimensions.</blockquote>

== Tor Browser Consumes 100% CPU after Clock Sync or Suspend/Resume ==

An upstream [https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/29497 bug] in Tor Browser causes the <code>firefox.real</code> process to consume excessive CPU whenever the connection to Tor's <code>ControlPort</code> is broken, which continues until Tor Browser is restarted. This is known to occur when the [[sdwdate]] clock synchronization daemon is restarted in Whonix-Gateway, whether manually via the [[sdwdate-gui]] time synchronization systray, or automatically via post-resume hooks. For details, refer to the related forum [https://forums.whonix.org/t/bug-restart-of-sdwdate-in-whonix-gateway-causes-100-cpu-use-of-tor-browser-in-whonix-workstation/9541/18 discussion]. ([https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/4969 original report on Qubes issue tracker])

As a workaround:

# Open <code>about:config</code> in the Tor Browser URL bar.
# Search for and set <code>extensions.torbutton.display_circuit</code> to <code>false</code>.
# [[#Restart_Tor_Browser|Restart Tor Browser]].

== Permission Issues ==
<ref>
https://www.reddit.com/r/Whonix/comments/ky7jqr/troubleshooting_i_just_installed_whonix_when_i/
</ref>

<u>Tip</u>: If something does not work, do not arbitrarily try to use sudo / root without indication that this would be appropriate. That only risks messing up user home folder permissions. See [[Root#Inappropriate_Use_of_Root_Rights|Inappropriate Use of Root Rights]].

<u>Attempt to fix</u>:

'''1.''' {{Open a product ws terminal}}

'''2.''' Owner Permissions Fix

Run the following command to reset permissions of user <code>user</code>'s home folder <code>/home/user</code> back to owner <code>user</code> and group <code>user</code>. That command is often sufficient to fix previous inappropriate use of root rights issues.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo chown --recursive user:user /home/user
}}

'''3.''' Folder Permission Fix

If that does not resolve permission issues, run the following slightly more experimental command to set <code>chmod</code> [https://chmodcommand.com/chmod-770/ <code>0770</code>] on all folders inside the user <code>user</code>'s home folder. <ref>
* As per Debian default [https://wiki.debian.org/UserPrivateGroups <u>u</u>ser <u>p</u>rivate <u>g</u>roups UPGs] each created user will be given their own group to use. Therefore <code>chmod</code> [https://chmodcommand.com/chmod-700/ <code>0700</code>] is not required and <code>chmod</code> <code>0770</code> is OK for all folders inside the user home folder.
* The following command <code>find</code>s all directories inside user home folder <code>/home/user</code> and sets the "executable" bit on them. If that seems strange or a security issue, it's not, see [https://askubuntu.com/questions/443789/what-does-chmod-x-filename-do-and-how-do-i-use-it Why must a folder be executable?]. It also grants user <code>user</code> and UPG <code>user</code> the required read and write access inside the user home folder.
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
find /home/user -type d -print0 {{!}} xargs -0 chmod 0770
}}

'''4.''' Files Permission Fix

Similar to the previous step, if that does not resolve permission issues, run the following slightly more experimental command to grant user <code>user</code> read and write access on all files inside the user <code>user</code>'s home folder. This may have some disadvantages. The only known example is for users of <code>git</code>. See footnote for further information. <ref>
Some applications might create write protected files inside the user's home folder.

As user. Do not do this. It is just an example for explanation!

{{CodeSelect|code=
rm -r .git
}}

<pre>
rm: remove write-protected regular file '.git/objects/1c/f2f7161f7529fd600a706278e06df20eb6dfd6'
</pre>

After running the following command, this protection would be gone. In that case, the user is free to modify the following command to have a more narrow scope, for example.

{{CodeSelect|code=
chmod --recursive ug+rw /home/user/.tb
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
chmod --recursive ug+rw /home/user/.cache/tb
}}
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
chmod --recursive ug+rw /home/user
}}

'''6.''' Done.

Chances are good that permission issues have been resolved. Try starting Tor Browser. In case the issue is persisting, the following options could be considered.

<u>Attempt to debug</u>:

Start Tor Browser Start by {{project_name_short}} in [[#In Verbose Mode|In Verbose Mode]]. This will show verbose output messages which might be useful for the user to identify the issue. In doubt, [[Support]] might help interpreting these messages.

<u>Other options</u>:

* [[#Delete and Reinstall Tor Browser|Delete and Reinstall Tor Browser]]
* [[Tor_Browser/Manual_Download|Tor Browser Manual Download]]
* [[Factory Reset]], re-install method

= Glossary and Key Terminology =
== Glossary ==
It is recommended to become familiar with terms regularly used by The Tor Project and {{project_name_short}}. One useful resource is the [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/community/glossary v1.0 Tor glossary] which is now available on The Tor Project community wiki page.

== Key Terminology ==
=== Tor vs Tor Browser ===

[[Tor]] is an anonymizer developed by The Tor Project. Tor Browser is a web browser developed by the Tor Project which is optimized for privacy. Please do not confuse {{Code2|Tor}} with {{Code2|Tor Browser}} when conversing about {{project_name_short}} topics.

=== Tor Browser Transparent Proxying ===

The Tor Browser "transparent proxying" feature <ref>https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TransparentProxy</ref> and/or the environment variable <code>TOR_TRANSPROXY=1</code> often cause confusion. It was an unfortunate naming decision by The Tor Project. This feature actually <u>[[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#Remove_Proxy_Settings|removes proxy settings]]</u>. With no proxy set, the user's system reverts to its default configuration. The effect of this decision is that Tor Browser networking will work in a similar fashion to an unconfigured Firefox browser.

This is potentially dangerous when done outside of {{project_name_short}} because Tor Browser's transparent proxying feature could result in clearnet traffic; for instance if the gateway does not have a transparent torification feature (like {{project_name_gateway_short}}). In the case of {{project_name_short}}, even if the transparent proxying feature is set, {{project_name_gateway_short}} will "torify" traffic and force it through Tor. Similarly, if transparent proxying is set and happens to use a JonDo-Gateway, traffic will be forced through JonDo.

One downside of the transparent proxying feature is that even when it is used inside {{project_name_short}}, it breaks Tor Browser's [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/3455 top level isolation for each separate tab].

Transparent proxying should not be confused with:

* Tor's <code>TransPort [address:]port|auto [isolation flags]</code> [https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en setting].
* Tor's [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TorifyHOWTO/IsolatingProxy IsolatingProxy].
