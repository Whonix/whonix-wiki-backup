= Introduction =
{{Community_Support}}

= Installation =
To use Anbox with {{project name long}}, apply the following steps.

'''1.''' Follow the general {{Kicksecure}} specific instructions.

{{upstream_wiki}}

'''2.''' Follow {{project name long}} specific instructions.

'''3.''' Done.

Other {{project name long}} specific notices can be found below.

= Anbox Configuration =
== Derivative Specific ==
Disabling [[{{project_name_workstation_short}} Firewall|{{project_name_workstation_long}} Firewall]] is unfortunately required. Otherwise there would be no network access. <ref>
This is because Anbox comes with its own bridged network. Whitelisting that interface in {{project_name_workstation_long}} firewall is [[Unsupported|undocumented]] and might require source code modifications. [[Reporting_Bugs#Patches_are_Welcome|Patches are Welcome]].

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl mask {{project_name_short_lowercase}}-firewall

'''2.''' Disable [https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Systemcheck systemcheck] in {{project_name_workstation_long}} Firewall.

{{Box|text=
{{Open with root rights|filename=

= Android x86 as a Workstation =

There are both distinct advantages and disadvantages of running Android applications in Android x86 Workstation. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/integrate-anbox-into-whonix-workstation/9642</ref>

'''Table:''' ''Android x86 Workstation Advantages and Disadvantages''

<div class="scroll-table">
{| class="wikitable"
|-

! scope="col"| '''Category'''
! scope="col"| '''Notes'''
|-

! scope="row"| Bootloader / Ramdisk
| It is possible to use Magisk to achieve root permissions and hide root from applications on Android x86. <ref>Some individuals have already achieved this.</ref>
|-

! scope="row"| Flexibility
|
* It is possible to use <code>adb</code> if Android x86 uses the same internal network as the Gateway and Workstation. <ref>Also, it may be possible to run ssh-server on {{project_name_workstation_long}} and connect the Android x86 through Termux or similar.</ref>
* Root access - Android x86 has a pre-installed superuser binary and manager so root access works out of the box. Applications with root access will work without any additional setup.
|-

! scope="row"| Networking
| Android x86 provides a virtual Wi-Fi interface (<code>wlan0</code>) so applications think that a real Wi-Fi connection is established (Anbox uses a bridge network interface).
|-

! scope="row"| Operating System
| The full Android stack implemented as Android x86 is a full operating system which requires hardware virtualization.
|-

! scope="row"| Security
| This configuration is less secure than utilizing a {{project_name_workstation_long}}. <ref>Although it may have more flexibility, as static IP connections on the Android x86 Workstation have been accomplished.</ref>
|-

! scope="row"| Software
| Any version of Android from 4.x to 9.x can be installed.
|-

! scope="row"| Speed
|  This configuration is slower than anbox installation as Android x86 VM does not provide any type of Guest Additions meaning no graphic card drivers are supported.
