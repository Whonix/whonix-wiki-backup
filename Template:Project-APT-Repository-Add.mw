</noinclude>There are two different options to enable the {{project_name_short}} APT repository. <ref>
<code>extrepo</code> vs manual:

* '''Usability:'''
** There are some detail usability differences. Using onion connection might be easier with manual method until {{project_name_short}} gets ported to Debian <code>13</code> / <code>trixie</code> because <code>extrepo</code> might get onion support then.
** Apart from that, <code>extrepo</code>'s usability seems generally better.
* '''Security:'''
** A detailed comparative research of both methods is unavailable.
** If usability is considered a security feature, then <code>extrepo</code> might be considered more secure. This is because users do not have to learn as much about [[Verifying Software Signatures]], [[OpenPGP]], its many [[Software Signature Verification Usability Issues and Proposed Solutions|Software Signature Verification Usability Issues]]. Debian which is already trusted by the user providing a trust path to the {{project_name_short}} signing key. Manual key fingerprint verification not required.
** The <code>extrepo</code> project is a huge amount of work adding all the signing keys for many different projects. The code for securely downloading a signing key in the Python is not among the most difficult programming tasks to get correct. Compared with <code>curl</code> (written in C), it might be more secure.
* '''Keeping support for manual method:'''
** Removal of the manual method is not planned. Since already written, the maintenance effort for that very part of documentation is low. In case <code>extrepo</code> signing key is outdated, get deprecated, it's easy to switch back to manual method.
