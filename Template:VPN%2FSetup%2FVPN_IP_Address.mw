When editing the VPN configuration file the use of DNS hostnames is not supported. This means IP address(s) of the VPN must be used. <ref> Many VPN service providers include DNS hostnames in their configuration files. The hostnames typically  include the providers name followed by (.net, .com, .ch, .pw).</ref>  Therefore, <code>vpn.riseup.net</code> cannot be used, but an IP address such as {{Code2|198.252.153.226}} should be used instead. To discover the IP address, check with the provider or use nslookup on the host. For example, to verify the actual IP address of the <code>vpn.riseup.net</code> DNS server, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
nslookup vpn.riseup.net
}}
