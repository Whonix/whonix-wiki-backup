Warning:

Deprecated. A dedicated [[Contribute#Contributor|contributor]] is required.

This has been deprecated because it is difficult to implement before the experimental, Debian reproducible toolchain is merged into the stable release. <ref>Old advice: Since Whonix 7.5.2, all Whonix Debian Packages have been deterministically built. This means if the Whonix Debian Packages 7.5.2 are built from source code, and 7.5.2 downloaded from the Whonix Debian repository, it is possible to diff the checksum (for example the {{Code2|sha512sum}}) of those files and they should match. This has been deprecated because of a dpkg bug. [https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=650077 The estimate of the Installed-Size can be wrong by a factor of 8, or a difference of 100MB] (note: this bug has now been resolved). Different underlying file systems cause different file sizes, leading to checksums not matching.</ref>
