| text    = QEMU (TCG) support has been deprecated in favor of [[KVM]]. The slow performance of pure emulation makes it impractical for the majority of Linux users. Most consumer systems should support the hardware virtualization extensions required by KVM. <ref>This wiki entry formerly stated: <blockquote>You can run {{project_name_long}} with QEMU instead of VirtualBox or KVM as well. There is no specific documentation about QEMU, because instructions would be very similar to the instructions on [[KVM|{{project_name_long}} KVM wiki page]]. Instead of importing {{project_name_long}} KVM Templates, you can simply import {{project_name_long}} QEMU Templates.</blockquote></ref>
