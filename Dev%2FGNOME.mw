= Security =
* GNOME encourages to install extensions by pressing an Install button on the gnome.org website. Example: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1160/dash-to-panel/
* Too many features in a default GNOME installation leading to a servers security bug.
** A simple file download has resulted in remote code execution.
** Simply clicking a link on a website has resulted in remote code execution.
** See the blog post: https://github.blog/2023-10-09-coordinated-disclosure-1-click-rce-on-gnome-cve-2023-43641/
** See the short demonstration video: https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CVE-2023-43641-poc.mp4
* social account integration

= Proxy Settings =

Setting GNOME 3 application wide proxy for improved [[Stream Isolation]] so far failed. Some notes.

<pre>
## install tools
apt install gconf2

## sources:
## https://developer.gnome.org/ProxyConfiguration/

## gsettings as root
## thanks to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10374520/gsettings-with-cron
## not sure if using gsettings as root means system wide here
sessionfile=`find "${HOME}/.dbus/session-bus/" -type f`
export `grep "DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS" "${sessionfile}" | sed '/^#/d'`

## list proxy settings
gsettings list-recursively org.gnome.system.proxy

## set socks proxy settings
gsettings set org.gnome.system.proxy.socks host "10.152.152.10"
gsettings set org.gnome.system.proxy.socks port "9159"
</pre>
