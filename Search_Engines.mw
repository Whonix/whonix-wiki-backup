{{intro|
Search engines are a complex topic that needs to be looked at from different angles. At {{project_name_long}} we are not sponsored by any search engine and do not promote any of them. We can only provide our criteria and suggestions.
}}

= Introduction =

For the convenience of our users, the Kicksecure (and Whonix) browser local welcome pages have curated search engine suggestions. We might also mention search engines elsewhere. '''These are neither endorsements nor promotions'''. See also [[Terms_of_Service#Non-Endorsement|Non-Endorsement]] policy. We [[Transparency#Search_Engines|are not sponsored by any search engine]]. These are suggestions solely based on our own criteria, that a user can ignore or follow.

To understand in more depth how we rank search engines, [[#Search_Engines_Criteria|read our search engine criteria]].

To understand which search engines we currently rank in which order, [[#Search_Engines_Evaluation|see our search engine evaluation]].

Usually we update this evaluation rarely (maybe once a year) as this topic is not our project focus. If you are really sure that:

* (1) our [[#Search_Engines_Evaluation|evaluation]] of a specific search engine is '''very flawed'''; AND
* (2) you can back your claims with research, feel free to [[Reporting_Bugs#Local_Browser_Homepage_-_Search_Engine_Feature_Request|file a Search Engine Reevaluation Request]].

But please be very mindful of the [https://forums.whonix.org/t/law-of-triviality-bikeshed/6739 Law of Triviality] as we '''cannot and will not deal simply with taste and opinion on this topic''' as it is very complex, very easy to fall into triviality and not our project focus.

= Search Engines Criteria =

Search engines suggestions are chosen by the following criteria and considerations. There is [[Transparency#Search_Engines|'''NO sponsorship''']] by any search engine provider.

{{IconSet|h2|1}} '''Must-Have Criteria for search engines'''. A search engine:

# '''Needs to provide GOOD RESULTS''': Even if a search engine doesn’t censor, its results can still be bad. This can happen if its web crawler is poor (bad at analyzing pages), if it doesn't index enough websites due to low resources, or if it uses a weak algorithm. Quality can be hard to measure, but popularity (number of users) often shows how good it is, because users tend to choose engines that give them what they want. Another way to evaluate it is to use the search engine as your main one for a week. If it performs well, it's likely good enough.
# '''Needs to have little to NO CENSORSHIP''': Censorship is hard to prove objectively, especially when trying to prove a negative. But if there is enough trustworthy third-party research or if the search engine itself admits to censorship, then it can be reasonably confirmed. "Significant censorship" means search results are heavily distorted, hiding accurate results in favor of less accurate ones. Even if some topics are censored more (like violent content) but other topics less than on other search engines, the engine might still be acceptable.
# '''Needs to be RELIABLE''': The search engine should be online nearly all the time (99.99% uptime or more). Also, the organization behind it should be expected to continue for at least the next 5 years.
# '''Needs to be relatively POLITICALLY AGNOSTIC''': Some search engines may show a strong political bias. This project aims to stay politically neutral to be inclusive and avoid pushing any agenda. The focus is on security and privacy. That is why strongly politically biased search engines are avoided.

{{IconSet|h2|2}} '''Booster Criteria for search engines''' - not needed but boosting the rating:

# '''Fewer captcha wrappers''': Some search engines bombard users with captchas or block them completely if their network is flagged (for example, Tor users, VPN users, or even some normal internet connections). Some privacy-focused search engine wrappers trigger fewer captchas. So this is seen as a useful feature.
# '''Availability on clearnet and Tor''': Some search engines are clearnet-only or Tor-only. It's slightly advantageous to be available on both.

{{IconSet|h2|3}} '''Non-criteria for search engines''', NOT considered:

# '''Not considered: Privacy by policy / ownership / location / hosted by which data center''': These factors are not considered. Even trusted projects like Debian and the Tor Project use services like AWS, Fastly, and CDNs.<ref>
* [https://forums.whonix.org/t/debian-apt-get-updates-over-https-ssl-tls-by-default-or-avoiding-amazon-aws-pick-one/6272 Debian uses CDNs Amazon AWS and Fastly]
* [https://www.torproject.org/about/sponsors/ Tor Project Sponsors Page Quote]
** <blockquote>Fastly’s global edge cloud platform processes, serves, and secures applications as close to users as possible, at the edge of the network. Fastly generously hosts our Tor Browser update downloads that can be fetched anonymously.</blockquote>
* [https://www.fastly.com/blog/sponsoring-tor-project-content-delivery-services Fastly Blog: Sponsoring Tor Project Content Delivery Services]
* [[Trust#Self-Hosting_vs_Third_Party_Hosting|Self-Hosting vs Third Party Hosting]]
</ref> Most privacy claims by search engines are just "privacy by policy", and key infrastructure remains hidden. That’s why trust is still needed. For comparison, [[Kicksecure]] focuses on security by design and [[Whonix]] on anonymity by design. Anything based only on policy is out of scope.
# '''Not considered: Privacy wrappers''': If a search engine only acts as a privacy wrapper, it’s not considered.
# '''Not considered: Non-JavaScript support''': This isn’t practical. Most modern websites need JavaScript. Limiting to only no-JavaScript search engines would drastically cut our options.
# '''Not considered: Open Source''': Very few search engines are Open Source. And even if they are, without access to their databases, the Open Source code is of limited use. For example, even if Google Search were Open Source, very few could actually run it. See also: {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=Artificial_intelligence
|text=Artificial intelligence
}} and [[Policy_On_Nonfreedom_Software|Policy On Non-Freedom Software]]
# '''Not considered: open database''': Very few search engines, if any, offer an open database.
# '''Not considered: decentralization''': Very few search engines, if any, are decentralized.
