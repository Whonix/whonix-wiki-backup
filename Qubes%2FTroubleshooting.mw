{{intro|
Troubleshooting Tor, Network and sdwdate Issues with {{project_name_short}}
}}
= Introduction =
Occasionally, mostly since the release of Qubes R4.1, {{q_project_name_short}} user are reporting connectivity issues as well as sdwdate issues. However, a lot issues {{q_project_name_short}} connectivity issues are [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]]. These issues are often misattributed to {{project_name_short}}.

Even though the issue is happening inside {{project_name_short}}, the cause is most often unrelated to {{project_name_short}} source code. Qubes is developed by [https://www.qubes-os.org Qubes OS Project], which is an independent entity. The is the norm in Linux distributions. To learn more about such relationships see {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=Linux User Experience versus Commercial Operating Systems
|text=Linux User Experience versus Commercial Operating Systems
}}. A different issue could be a [[Network Obstacle]].

{{project_name_short}} does integration work {{project_name_short}} integrated into the Qubes platform. To use a simple analogy, {{project_name_short}} stays "on the outside". Very few modifications are made to Qubes through Qubes dom0 package [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-core-admin-addon-whonix qubes-core-admin-addon-whonix] as described for developers in the [[Dev/Qubes#qvm-tags|{{q_project_name_short}} <code>qvm-tags</code>]] chapter.

Qubes R4.1 was released with some "strange" connectivity bugs such as [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/7123 this].

A Qubes user might think the user has updated Qubes which should include bug fixes but actually the update might not have happened due to Qubes Updater issues. [[Qubes/Update|Quote]]:

<blockquote>The situation is however [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-posts/pull/79#issuecomment-1042934326 complicated] due to [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/labels/C:%20updates Qubes Updater Issues], most notably such as:

* [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/7254 qubes-dom0-update shows <code>No updates available</code> in case of network is down / <code>qubes-dom0-update</code> fails to notice if repositories are unreachable / network is down],
* [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/6585 Updating via Salt falsely claims to succeed when it actually fails] and
* [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/6635 Replace built-in Qube Manager update functionality with the Qubes Update tool].</blockquote>

To remedy this kind of issue, [[#Connectivity Troubleshooting Approaches|there are a few approaches]].

= Qubes sdwdate specific =
It is often suspected that sdwdate might be the cause.

This is unlikely. No issues are reported for {{project_name_short}} on other platforms such as {{project_name_short}} for VirtualBox which has a magnitude of more users but no (or very rare) similar connectivity bug reports.

[[sdwdate-gui]] makes Tor issues in {{q_project_name_short}} more visible due to its graphical indication and easily accessible logs.

However, at time of writing [[sdwdate-gui]] is mostly a [[Troubleshooting#Unsuitable Connectivity Troubleshooting Tools|unsuitable connectivity troubleshooting tool]].

To exclude the possibly that sdwdate is the cause, the user could attempt to disable the autostart of sdwdate.

* info: [[sdwdate]]
* try: [https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Sdwdate#Disable_Autostart Disable Autostart of sdwdate]

= Connectivity Troubleshooting Approaches =
== Generally ==
'''1.''' The user is encouraged to learn about general ([[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]]) Qubes Updater issues and make sure updates are really installed. See also [[Qubes/Update]].

'''2.''' [[Troubleshooting#Connectivity Troubleshooting|Connectivity Troubleshooting]]

'''3.''' [[Tor#Connectivity_Troubleshooting|Tor Connectivity Troubleshooting]]

== Qubes sys-net workaround ==
Complete the following steps:

# Shut down <code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code>.
# Change the <code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code> NetVM setting from <code>sys-firewall</code> to <code>sys-net</code>.
# Restart <code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code>.

This procedure might help, but should not be considered a final solution. <ref>
This procedure was useful for [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_short}}]] R3.2 users, although the Qubes bug report is now resolved: https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/2141
</ref>

Please report if this workaround helped.

= Future =
The community is encouraged not to wait for {{project_name_short}} to fix these connectivity issues since this unfortunately is unlikely to happen. This is because {{project_name_short}} developers are not affected by these connectivity issues, these are non-reproducible issues and sometimes these are caused by already fixed Qubes bugs which are not yet fixed on Qubes due to Qubes Updater issues.

= Related Qubes Bugs =

= Unexpected autostart of sys-whonix =
If using multiple {{q_project_name_short}} VMs, the user should make sure to have followed the relevant documentation.

== sdwdate-gui qrexec settings ==
=== sdwdate-gui qrexec settings fix ===
* A) New installation of Qubes R4.2: These steps are very most likely not required.
* B) A fully updated Qubes should not require any of the following steps.

'''1.''' [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-core-admin-addon-whonix/blob/master/qubes-rpc-policy/80-whonix.policy <code>80-whonix.policy</code> on github] ([https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QubesOS/qubes-core-admin-addon-whonix/master/qubes-rpc-policy/80-whonix.policy raw]) should look same as <code>/etc/qubes/policy.d/80-whonix.policy</code> in dom0.

'''2.''' The following files are legacy and could optionally be safely removed if step 1 was confirmed.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo rm /etc/qubes-rpc/policy/whonix.GatewayCommand
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo rm /etc/qubes-rpc/policy/whonix.NewStatus
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo rm /etc/qubes-rpc/policy/whonix.SdwdateStatus
}}

=== sdwdate-gui qrexec debugging ===
==== dom0 journal log file reading ====
Check, follow dom0 journal log file while reproducing sdwdate-gui qrexec messages.

Look for <code>denied:</code> messages.

In dom0.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo journalctl | grep denied:
}}

Or.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo journalctl -f
}}

==== sdwdate-watcher debugging ====
'''1.''' Inside the Whonix-Workstation App Qube.

'''2.''' Kill sdwdate-watcher.

sdwdate-watcher is the part of sdwdate-gui which watches sdwdate events from /var/run/sdwdate folder and notifies the <code>gateway</code> configured in <code>/usr/local/etc/sdwdate-gui.d/50_user.conf</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
killall sdwdate-watcher
}}

'''3.''' Start sdwdate-watcher.

{{CodeSelect|code=
/usr/libexec/sdwdate-gui/start-maybe
}}

'''4.''' Restart sdwdate.

This is to produce new sdwdate activity that sdwdate-watcher can observe.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl restart sdwdate
}}

'''5.''' See if there are any error messages.

==== qvm-tags verification ====
Debugging Qubes qrexec is largely [[unspecific|unspecific to {{q_project_name_short}}]]. Qubes qrexec debugging instructions from other resources such as perhaps the Qubes website should equally apply.

Note: Any commands that follow must be run inside Qubes dom0.

'''1.''' Background information on qvm-tags.

See if you can make head or tail of [[Dev/Qubes#qvm-tags|qvm-tags developer notes]]. If not, skip this step.

'''2.''' Check qvm-tags of {{project_name_gateway_long}} net qube.

Note: Replace <code>sys-whonix</code> with the actual name of the Whonix-Gateway you are using.

{{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-tags sys-whonix
}}

Expected printout should include:

<pre>
anon-gateway
</pre>

'''3.''' Check qvm-tags of {{project_name_workstation_long}} App Qube.

Note: Replace <code>sys-whonix</code> with the actual name of the Whonix-Workstation you are using.

{{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-tags anon-whonix
}}

Expected printout should include:

<pre>
anon-vm
</pre>

'''4.''' Check qvm-tags of {{project_name_gateway_short}} Template.

Note: Replace <code>{{project_name_gateway_template}}</code> with the actual name of the Whonix-Gateway Template you are using.

{{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-tags {{project_name_gateway_template}}
}}

Expected printout should include:

<pre>
whonix-updatevm
</pre>

'''5.''' Check qvm-tags of {{project_name_workstation_short}} Template.

Note: Replace <code>{{project_name_gateway_template}}</code> with the actual name of the Whonix-Workstation Template you are using.

{{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-tags {{project_name_workstation_template}}
}}

Expected printout should include:

<pre>
whonix-updatevm
</pre>
