'''Unavailable.'''

Please consider making a [[Donate|<u>non</u>-tax-deductible donation]].

There is currently no charitable non-profit host organization that partnered with {{project_name_short}}.

When donating to a Freedom Software project that has partnered with a non-profit organization for tax-deductible donation processing, there is a processing fee associated with the non-profit. While some organizations have reasonable fees, non-tax-deductible donations incur lower overhead costs and are therefore preferred.

The challenges in this regard revolve around automation, legal requirements, and overhead. Due to these constraints, the {{project_name_short}} project does at this time not have the necessary resources to establish its own charity organization.
