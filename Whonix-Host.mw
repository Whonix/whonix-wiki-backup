= What is Whonix as a host operating system? =

Whonix as a host {{os}} is a complete Operating System provided by {{project_name_short}} developers, specifically designed to run [[Whonix]] virtual machines ("[[Whonix-Gateway]]" and "[[Whonix-Workstation]]").

[[Based on Kicksecure]], Whonix as a host OS comes out-of-the-box with all {{kicksecure}} security features and ready-to-use, pre-installed Whonix virtual machines.

By default, Whonix as a host OS runs from a USB flash drive as a Live ISO, like any modern Linux distribution. This means you can use and test the whole system, including Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation, without making any changes to your computer ("live" or "amnesic" mode).

Whonix as a host OS can also be installed from the USB flash drive onto an internal hard drive or onto an external drive, such as another USB flash drive, to be used as a permanent Operating System ("persistent" mode).

In other words:

* Supported installation <u>source medium</u>: USB; DVD
* Supported installation <u>target devices</u>: internal HDD; external HDD; USB; eSATA

= Advantages =
* Whonix-Host ISO is available as a Live ISO, i.e. it can boot Whonix-Host from a Live DVD or Live USB.
* Whonix-Host, once installed, includes a boot menu option to start in either persistent mode or live mode.
* No clearnet traffic by default. ([https://forums.whonix.org/t/should-whonix-host-be-fully-torified-by-default/7404/16 details]) (not implemented yet!)

= Differences with Qubes-Whonix =
* Does not have some of the [https://forums.whonix.org/t/qubes-whonix-security-disadvantages-help-wanted/8581 Qubes-Whonix security disadvantages].
* Better hardware support (same as Debian).
* Does not involve Fedora on the dom0 host.
* No, avoiding all clearnet traffic by default in Qubes is not easily possible. See:
** [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1814 sys-net phones home to fedoraproject.org for captive portal detection] (Ticket was closed but the issue was not fixed.)
** [https://forums.whonix.org/t/qubes-whonix-gateway-as-clockvm/19015 Qubes-Whonix-Gateway as ClockVM]

= Installation =

== Recommended System Specifications ==
TODO: update

*A 64 bit processor with virtualization capacities
*Minimum 4GB of RAM
*Minimum 4GB USB flash drive
*Optional: another flash drive or HDD/SSD with minimum 10GB of free space if you intend to install Whonix-Host

== Installation Steps ==
