The Tor software does not support UDP. The feature request [https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/7830 UDP over Tor] was created in 2013 and [https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/7830#note_2402996 closed as won't fix] by upstream, The Tor Project in 2018. It is therefore highly unlikely that the UDP over Tor feature will ever be implemented. This is [[Unspecific|unspecific to {{project name long}}]].

Tor provides a <code>DnsPort</code> but that is unrelated.

If UDP is urgently required in {{project_name_long}}, a limited workaround is provided. For the most secure method, see [[Tunnel_UDP_over_Tor|Tunnel UDP over Tor]].
