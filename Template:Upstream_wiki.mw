* <u>Keep using {{project_name_short}}:</u> This does <u>not</u> mean the user should switch to Kicksecure.
* <u>Where to apply the instructions:</u> The instructions should be applied inside {{project_name_short}}.

}}</u>. Apply the instructions inside {{project_name_short}}, <u>not</u> Kicksecure.'''
