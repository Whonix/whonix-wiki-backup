{{intro|
This request is too difficult, unlikely to get resolved through free forum discussions.
}}

* '''Free support unlikely''': Based on experience, it is highly unlikely that asking in free forums will result in anyone providing support for such a complex issue at no cost. The effort required to understand the problem, design a reliable solution, and assist with implementation often makes this type of support impractical to offer for free. While some generous individuals in the community may try to help, relying on this approach for a solution is not a realistic expectation.
* '''Risk of recommending an external IT development/support company''': Even if one were to find a contractor with the specific expertise required, there are additional risks involved in recommending them. Miscommunication or unclear expectations between the user and the contractor could lead to suboptimal outcomes, dissatisfaction, and frustration on both sides. Worse, this could potentially create unfair blame toward the tools or platforms involved, such as {{project_name_short}}, and damage trust within the community.
* '''Pricing expectations''': Such projects are not cheap. While it might be possible to hire someone for a few hundred USD in rare cases, a robust, reliable, and thoroughly tested setup is more likely to cost thousands of USD. Many users may not be aware of how complicated or expensive these setups are, and they may become frustrated or offended by standard market pricing. This could lead to further challenges in navigating expectations.
* '''Outlook''': This response is not intended to discourage exploration or learning but rather to set realistic expectations about the resources and expertise required. If this is something you truly want to pursue, being prepared to invest the necessary time and financial resources will be critical to success.
