[https://telegram.org/ Telegram] is a cross-platform, fully featured instant messenger. The [https://telegram.org/faq#q-what-is-telegram-what-do-i-do-here Telegram FAQ] describes the basic architecture:
<blockquote>Telegram is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security, it’s super-fast, simple, and free. You can use Telegram on all your devices at the same time — your messages sync seamlessly across any number of your phones, tablets, or computers.<br />
<br />
With Telegram, you can send messages, photos, videos, and files of any type (doc, zip, mp3, etc.), as well as create groups for up to 200,000 people or channels for broadcasting to unlimited audiences. You can write to your phone contacts and find people by their usernames. As a result, Telegram is like SMS and email combined — and can take care of all your personal or business messaging needs. In addition to this, we support end-to-end encrypted voice calls.</blockquote>

Advantages include: <ref>
https://telegram.org/faq
</ref>

* access to chats across multiple devices

Disadvantages include:

* The application requires the user to register a phone number to create a Telegram account. See also [[Phone Number Validation]]. This is why it is not recommended for anonymous messaging at this time.
* End-to-end client encryption is <u>not</u> enabled by default.
** The desktop version has no end-to-end encryption feature.
** The mobile version has easily confused encrypted versus non-encrypted chats.
** For the purpose of encrypted chats, it is better to use a messenger that is always encrypted end-to-end by default.
* At the time of writing, starting a phone call from a secret (encrypted) chat results in a regular (unencrypted) call. The call log appears in the chat log of the regular (unencrypted) chat, not in the secret (encrypted) one. There is no visual feedback to distinguish an encrypted call from an unencrypted one, even if encrypted calls exist.

One viewpoint is to see Telegram as a modern public chat or IRC alternative.
