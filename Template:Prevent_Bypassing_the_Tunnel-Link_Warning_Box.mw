* Apply the instructions [[Tunnels/Prevent Bypassing the Tunnel-Link|Prevent Bypassing the Tunnel-Link]] to avoid unexpected results such as broken connectivity and/or traffic bypassing the tunnel-link and traffic only going through Tor.
** <u>[[Qubes|{{q_project_name_long}}]] exception</u>: There is one tunnel configuration where [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_long}}]] users are better placed. When a separate tunnel-link VM is used between <code>{{project_name_workstation_vm}}</code> and <code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code> (<code>{{project_name_workstation_vm}}</code> &rarr; <code>Tunnel-link</code> &rarr; <code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code>), these connections will fail without the following modifications.
