{{Release_Upgrade}}

For the latest instructions on a release upgrade from {{project_name_long}} 15 to {{project_name_long}} 16, see [[Release_Upgrade_{{project_name_short}}_15_to_{{project_name_short}}_16|here]].

An Standard [[Upgrade]] makes sure all packages within a major release are up-to-date. In contrast, a Release Upgrade upgrades from one major version to another.

Due to technical limitations, a standard ("everyday") upgrade cannot perform the same functions as a release upgrade. The latter procedure upgrades a far greater number of packages, often removes select packages and requires the user to apply extra steps as per release upgrade documentation.

What is better? Upgrade or Image Re-Installation? See [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Update_vs_Image_Re-Installation|Update vs Image Re-Installation]].

It is very much discouraged to run the [https://github.com/Kicksecure/legacy-dist/blob/master/usr/sbin/release-upgrade <code>release-upgrade</code>] command without following the [[Release_Upgrade_{{project_name_short}}_15_to_{{project_name_short}}_16|release upgrade instructions for the version intended to be upgraded]].
