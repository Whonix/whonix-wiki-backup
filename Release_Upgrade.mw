{{intro|
A standard upgrade ensures that all packages within a major release are up-to-date, while a release upgrade upgrades from one major version to another.

* <u>Standard upgrade:</u> Ensures all packages within a major release are up-to-date using [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates|regular upgrade]] procedures.
* <u>Release upgrade:</u> Upgrades the system from one major version to another, affecting many more packages.

* <u>Everyday upgrades are limited:</u> A standard ("everyday") upgrade cannot replace a release upgrade due to technical limitations.
* <u>Release upgrade impacts:</u> A release upgrade often removes certain packages and requires users to follow extra steps outlined in the release upgrade documentation.
* <u>How to check availability:</u> To find out if a release upgrade is available, see [[Stay Tuned]].
* <u>Upgrade vs re-installation:</u> For a comparison between upgrading and performing a full image re-installation, see [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Update_vs_Image_Re-Installation|Update vs Image Re-Installation]].
* <u>Release upgrade instructions:</u>
** <s>To upgrade from {{project_name_long}} 16 to {{project_name_short}} 17, follow the steps at [[Release_Upgrade_16_to_17|Release Upgrade 16 to 17]].</s> (Outdated)
