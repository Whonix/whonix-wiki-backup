Screen Resolution, DPI (dots per inch), Full Screen, Tor Browser window size (maximization?)
}}

= Screen Resolution =
Recommended screen resolution: 1920x1080

rationale: [https://forums.whonix.org/t/make-screen-resolution-1920x1080-by-default-for-all-vms/9143 make screen resolution 1920x1080 by default for all VMs]

= Full Screen =
Screen recommendation:

* [[Non-Qubes-Whonix|{{non_q_project_name_short}}]]: Not using full screen. [[Desktop#Use_Full-screen_Mode|Use Full-screen Mode]].
* [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_short}}]]: Using full screen. [[Desktop#Avoid_VM_Full_Screen_Mode|Avoid VM Full Screen Mode]].

= Tor Browser Window Size =
It is best not to maximize the Tor Browser window. Rationale for this can be found in chapter [[Tor_Browser#Why_do_I_have_White_Bars_around_my_Tor_Browser_Content.3F|Why do I have White Bars around my Tor Browser Content?]]

= DPI =
It is best to keep default settings and not change DPI settings.

= Custom Settings =
Do custom settings negatively affect anonymity?

This is [[Unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]]. This is up to Tor Browser. Therefore this question is best redirected to Tor Browser as per [[Self Support First Policy]].

For abundance of caution, reasonable default settings are being recommended on this page.
