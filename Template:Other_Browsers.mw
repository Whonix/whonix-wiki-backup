'''Warning:'''

In {{project_name_short}}, for better anonymity it is recommended to use only Tor Browser for browsing the internet. Use of any browsers such as [[Chromium]], {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=Firefox
|text=Firefox
}}, Opera and others is discouraged. Reasons for that are elaborated on the [[Tor Browser]] wiki page.

{{project_name_short}} is The Everything Tor {{os}}. [[About#Security_by_Isolation|All internet traffic is routed]] through the [[Why_does_Whonix_use_Tor|Tor anonymity network]], without exceptions. Whonix is the "All Tor Operating System", featuring [[Reliable_IP_Hiding|reliable IP hiding]].

This of course also includes Chromium, Firefox, Opera and other browsers. Due to {{project_name_short}}'s [https://www.whonix.org/#explain Watertight Privacy Architecture], {{project_name_short}} provides the strongest protection of your [[Data_Collection_Techniques#IP_Address|IP address]].

The reason why browsers other than Tor Browser are discouraged is because hiding your identity is harder than just hiding your IP. See also [[IP_hiding_is_outdated|IP Hiding is an Outdated Threat Model]]. This is also elaborated on the [[Tor Browser]] wiki page.
