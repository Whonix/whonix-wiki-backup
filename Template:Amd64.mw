<code>amd64</code> might imply AMD only. This is wrong.

<code>amd64</code> means '''<u>Intel</u> and <u>AMD</u>'''.

For technical reasons, in Debian (and in many other Linux / Freedom Software related places) both, Intel and AMD, is called <code>amd64</code>. This is common knowledge without controversy among technical people, in doubt see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64 Wikipedia X86-64].
