! Other Issues

In case technical issues are experienced, such as a broken <code>dom0</code> or broken <code>qubes-dom0-update</code>, these are Qubes issues and [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]]. They should therefore either be reported to [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues qubes-issues], or added as a comment to an existing issue there (if appropriate). This is further elaborated in [https://forums.whonix.org/t/what-to-post-in-this-qubes-whonix-forum-and-what-not/2275 What to post in this Qubes-Whonix forum and what not.]

! {{q_project_name_short}} 17 to {{q_project_name_short}} 18 Release Upgrade
| This is a notice for users who currently have {{q_project_name_short}} <u>17</u> installed.

|quote=
Availability and Qubes-Whonix Support: Qubes R4.2 versus Qubes R4.3?

* <u>Qubes R4.2:</u> Qubes-Whonix 18 won’t be available for Qubes R4.2. Even though Qubes R4.3 is only available for testers at the time of writing, a stable release is probably not far away. Qubes-Whonix 17 users on Qubes R4.2 are encouraged to consider upgrading to Qubes-Whonix 18 on Qubes R4.3 as soon as possible. This is not ideal, but it is what it is.
* <u>versus</u>
* <u>Qubes R4.3:</u> Qubes-Whonix 18 is available.

(More details in: [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/10219 decide availability of Kicksecure, and Whonix 18 (Debian trixie based) on Qubes R4.2 versus R4.3 #10219]
|context=[https://forums.whonix.org/t/qubes-whonix-18-for-qubes-r4-3-major-release-testers-wanted/22517 Qubes-Whonix 18 release announcement]
}}

* <u>Upgrade coexistence:</u> If {{q_project_name_short}} <u>17</u> is installed and you want to get {{q_project_name_short}} <u>18</u>, there is no need to uninstall {{q_project_name_short}} <u>17</u> before proceeding according to the instructions on this wiki page. This is because the new templates (<code>whonix-workstation-18</code>, <code>whonix-gateway-18</code>) will be installed alongside the old templates (<code>whonix-workstation-17</code>, <code>whonix-gateway-17</code>).

* <u>Template persistence:</u> In this case, App Qubes that were previously configured to use {{q_project_name_short}} <u>17</u> templates will keep using them -- the Templates of any App Qubes are not automatically changed to the newly installed {{q_project_name_short}} <u>18</u> templates. This is a Qubes default and [[unspecific]] to {{q_project_name_short}}. <ref>
This is also true for other distribution Templates. For example, users of the Qubes <code>debian-12</code> Template will not have all their App Qubes updated to the new <code>debian-13</code> Template by default when it is downloaded.
</ref>

* <u>Manual change required:</u> Therefore, a manual change must be applied to App Qubes settings by the user. The rationale is to prevent unexpected changes of an App Qube's Template without the user's consent. <ref>
For example, this could result in breakage if custom-installed applications in the old Template were not available in the new Template.
</ref>

* <u>Recommendation:</u> After the {{q_project_name_short}} installation has finished, it is recommended to manually change the setting of any App Qubes still using {{q_project_name_short}} <u>17</u> Templates to the {{q_project_name_short}} <u>18</u> Templates. <ref>
* [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/5183 Qubes-Whonix ticket: Installing the new Whonix Template results in <code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code> still using the old Whonix Template (#5183)]
* [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/6904 Qubes ticket: improve process for migrating from older customized Template to newer (e.g. Debian 10->11, Fedora 33->34) (#6904)]
</ref>

* <u>Alternative:</u> A wholly different, alternative option is to ignore all the advice on this wiki page and instead perform a [[Release Upgrade]] according to the [[Release Upgrade_17_to_18|Release Upgrade {{project_name_short}} <u>17</u> to {{project_name_short}} <u>18</u>]] instructions.

! Preexisting {{q_project_name_short}} 18 Installations
|
This is a notice for users who already have {{q_project_name_short}} <u>18</u> installed.

* <u>Backup reminder:</u> If any user data was stored in {{q_project_name_short}} VMs, back up any existing data before re-installation.
* <u>Uninstallation requirement:</u> If you are already running [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_short}}]] <u>18</u>, it must be [[Qubes/Uninstall|uninstalled]] before a complete <u>re-installation</u> is performed. This is also necessary when [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_short}}]] <u>18</u> is bundled as part of future Qubes releases, and auto-configuration is selected during the installation.
* <u>Re-installation options:</u> Choose <u>re-installation</u> option '''A)''' <u>OR</u> '''B)'''. (Listed in order of preference)
** '''A)''' [[Qubes/Uninstall|Uninstall {{q_project_name_short}}]] and then [[Qubes/Install|Install {{q_project_name_short}}]]; <u>OR</u>
** '''B)''' [[Qubes/Reinstall|Reinstall the {{project_name_short}} Template]].
