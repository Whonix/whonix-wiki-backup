In case technical issues are experienced such as broken <code>dom0</code>, broken <code>qubes-dom0-update</code> are Qubes issues and [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]] and should therefore be either reported to [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues qubes-issues], or added as a comment to an existing issue there (if appropriate).

! scope="row"| {{q_project_name_short}} 16 to {{q_project_name_short}} 17 Release Upgrade
| This is a notice for users who currently have {{q_project_name_short}} <u>16</u> installed.

If {{q_project_name_short}} <u>16</u> is installed and you want to get {{q_project_name_short}} <u>17</u>, there is no need to uninstall {{q_project_name_short}} <u>16</u> before proceeding according to the instructions on this wiki page. This is because the new templates (<code>whonix-workstation-17</code>, <code>whonix-gateway-17</code>) will be installed alongside the old templates (<code>whonix-ws-16</code>, <code>whonix-gw-16</code>).

In this case, App Qubes that were previously configured to use {{q_project_name_short}} <u>16</u> templates will keep using them -- the Templates of any App Qubes are not automatically changed to the newly installed {{q_project_name_short}} <u>16</u> templates. This is a Qubes default and [[unspecific]] to {{q_project_name_short}}. <ref>This is also true for other distribution Templates. For example, users of the Qubes <code>debian-10</code> Template will not have all their App Qubes updated to the new <code>debian-11</code> Template by default when it is downloaded.</ref> Therefore, a manual change must be applied to App Qubes settings by the user. The rationale is to prevent unexpected changes of an App Qube's Template without the user's consent. <ref>For example, this could result in breakage if custom-installed applications in the old Template were not available in the new Template.</ref>

After the {{q_project_name_short}} installation has finished, it is recommended to manually change the setting of any App Qubes still using {{q_project_name_short}} <u>16</u> Templates to the {{q_project_name_short}} <u>17</u> Templates. <ref>
* [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/5183 Qubes-Whonix ticket: Installing the new Whonix Template results in <code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code> still using the old Whonix Template (#5183)]
* [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/6904 Qubes ticket: improve process for migrating from older customized Template to newer (e.g. Debian 10->11, Fedora 33->34) (#6904)]
</ref>
-----
A wholly different, alternative option is to ignore all the advice on this wiki page and instead perform a [[Release Upgrade]] according to the [[Release Upgrade_16_to_17|Release Upgrade {{project_name_short}} <u>16</u> to {{project_name_short}} <u>17</u>]] instructions.
|-

! scope="row"| Preexisting {{q_project_name_short}} 17 Installations
|
This is a notice for users who already have {{q_project_name_short}} <u>17</u> installed.

If any user data was stored in {{q_project_name_short}} VMs, before re-installation, back up any existing data.
-----
If you are already running [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_short}}]] <u>17</u>, it must be [[Qubes/Uninstall|uninstalled]] before a complete <u>re-installation</u> is performed. This is also necessary when [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_short}}]] <u>17</u> is bundled as part of future Qubes releases, and auto-configuration is selected during the installation.

Choose <u>re-installation</u> options '''A)''' <u>OR</u> '''B)'''. (listed in order of preference)

* '''A)''' [[Qubes/Uninstall|Uninstall {{q_project_name_short}}]] and then [[Qubes/Install|Install {{q_project_name_short}}]]; <u>OR</u>
* '''B)''' [[Qubes/Reinstall|Reinstall the {{project_name_short}} Template]].
