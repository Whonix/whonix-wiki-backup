Guide to networking inside Qubes Templates, including how to use commands like curl, gpt and git.
}}
= Introduction =
Qubes Templates are non-networked by default. This is a security feature.

* Why are APT operating system upgrades functional? Qubes has a special implementation for that. APT isn't using networking in Qubes Templates but qrexec. Documented on the [[Qubes/UpdatesProxy]] wiki page.
* How to make other applications functional inside Qubes Templates such as <code>curl</code>, <code>gpg</code>, <code>git</code>? This is documented below.

This is [[unspecific|unspecific to Whonix]]. This is as per Qubes upstream design default. Whonix does not influence this.

<u>Warning:</u> Users are not supposed to do that. However, [[Advanced Users]] understanding {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=Threat_Modeling
|text=Computer Security Threat Modeling
}}, that understand {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=Mental_Model
|text=Computer Security Mental Model
}} might sometimes do this.

<u>Note:</u> Replace <code>command</code> with the actual command. <ref>
<code>UWT_DEV_PASSTHROUGH=1</code> is redundant but harmless in some cases. <code>UWT_DEV_PASSTHROUGH=1</code> is required in some cases to circumvent Whonix's default [[Stream Isolation]] wrappers. Otherwise, original <code>.anondist-orig</code> binaries would need to be used.
