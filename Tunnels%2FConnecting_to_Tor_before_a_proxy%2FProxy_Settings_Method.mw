== Configure Applications to use Proxy Settings Method ==
'''General information ([[unspecific|unspecific to {{project name long}}]]):'''

* <u>Essentials:</u> See the notices on top of this wiki chapter. These links should be read first.
* <u>Different methods available:</u> One option to make an application use a proxy is to use the application's native proxy settings. This is explained in this wiki chapter. For alternative methods, see the mini navigation on the very top of this wiki page.
* <u>Essentials:</u> This of course supposes, that the application has proxy settings.
* <u>Leak Potential:</u> There could be leaks.
* <u>Leak Definition:</u> What is a leak in this context? A means, that the user thinks the application is using the proxy but actually the application is not using the proxy.
** <u>Application Specific:</u> If proxy settings are honored by an application or not is another question and out of scope of this documentation because this is difficult.
** <u>Difficulty:</u>  Since manual proxy configuration using the application's proxy settings is very difficult and very vulnerable to leaks, the {{project name long}} project had been founded.
** <u>Reliability:</u> {{project name long}} is a project which does only one thing but does that one thing well. That one thing is to configure a (virtual) machine to securely, reliability and always use [[Why does Whonix use Tor|Tor]] which is similar to a proxy but much better. Also called a leak shield or fail-safe mechanism.
** <u>No dedicated proxy project:</u> There is no software / project that ensures that a proxy is always reliably used, i.e. a leak shield / fail-safe mechanism for proxies.
** <u>Instructions Quality:</u> There is generally very little information on the subject of configuring a proxy including a leak shield. Development activity is very low to non-existing. For some old instructions on how to set proxy settings for some applications, the user could have a look at the [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TorifyHOWTO TorifyHOWTO].

'''{{project name long}} specific part:'''

* <u>Location:</u> Run the application inside inside {{project_name_workstation_long}}.
* <u>Deactivation of Stream Isolation required:</u> There is a '''[[Stream_Isolation#List|list of applications that come where extra steps are required]]'''. <u>Before proceeding, it is highly recommended for the user to look up the application which should be configured for use with an extra-tunnel link in that list.</u> This is because these applications are pre-configured for [[Stream Isolation]]. These settings have to be undone. This is documented in the chapters below on this wiki page.
* <u>Proxy Settings:</u> Other than that there is no difference from using proxy settings in a usual way it would be done outside of {{project name long}}.
* <u>Internet Traffic Routing:</u> If the application:
** '''A)''' honors the proxy settings: traffic goes: '''<code>User</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>Proxy</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code>'''
** '''B)''' does not honor the proxy settings / has a leak bug: traffic goes '''<code>User</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code>'''

{{Anchor|Tor_Browser_Proxy_Configuration}}

= Important Application Specific Notes =
== Tor Browser Notes ==
'''1.''' Check applicability of these instructions.

Does the user need to follow these instructions? Only if the user intents to use Tor Browser with an extra tunnel-link. For example, if the user only intents to use a different application such as curl with an extra tunnel-link, then the instructions in this very wiki chapter can be skipped. In that case, see the other wiki chapters on this page.

'''2.''' Remove default proxy settings by Tor Browser and set custom proxy settings.

{{Template:TorBrowser_Proxy_Configuration}}

'''3.''' Done.

The process of configuring an extra tunnel-link for Tor Browser has been completed.

== Misc Application Notes ==
'''1.''' Check applicability of these instructions.

Do the user need to follow these instructions? Only if the user intents to use any of the applications which are on the [[Stream_Isolation#By_Settings|list of stream isolated by proxy settings]] with an extra tunnel-link. For example, if the user only intents to use Tor Browser with an extra tunnel-link, then the instructions in this very wiki chapter can be skipped. In that case, see above chapter.

'''2.''' Remove default proxy settings by {{project name long}}.

{{project_name_long}} ships a number of applications pre-configured for using proxy settings by default. This is for a different purpose. For the purpose of [[Stream Isolation]]. If the application you want to tunnel through the extra tunnel-link is on that list, it would conflict with your custom proxy settings. In that case, you need to first remove these proxy settings.

'''3.''' Set custom proxy settings.

This is [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project name long}}]] and [[Unsupported|undocumented]].

'''4.''' Done.

The process of configuring an extra tunnel-link for a miscellaneous application has been completed.

== uwt wrapped application notes ==
'''1.''' Check applicability of these instructions.

Do the user need to follow these instructions? Only if the user intents to use any application in the [[Stream_Isolation#By_uwt_wrapper|list of uwt wrapped applications]] with an extra tunnel-link. For example, if the user only intents to use Tor Browser with an extra tunnel-link, then the instructions in this very wiki chapter can be skipped. In that case, see above chapter.

'''2.''' Remove uwt wrapper by {{project name long}}.

{{project_name_long}} ships a number of applications pre-configured for using uwt wrappers by default. If the application you want to tunnel through the extra tunnel-link is on that list, it would conflict with your custom proxy settings. In that case, you need to disable that uwt wrapper first.

'''3.''' Set custom proxy settings.

This is [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project name long}}]] and [[Unsupported|undocumented]].

'''4.''' Done.
