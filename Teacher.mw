{{intro|
Finding a volunteer teacher online is generally unlikely, though not impossible. While some users may be fortunate to find helpful individuals willing to assist informally, such opportunities are rare. Most users should explore alternative methods of self-education and community-based support.

'''Alternatives:'''

* <u>Linux user group:</u> Join a local Linux user group. These are community gatherings of Linux enthusiasts, ranging from beginners to experts, who share knowledge, provide assistance, and organize discussions or presentations. Many groups hold in-person meetups as well as online sessions via chat or voice. Such groups exist in many cities worldwide and also operate virtually, making them widely accessible.
* <u>Increase your skills:</u> Work with complex Linux-related computing tasks through self-study and consistent practice. This helps build the confidence and knowledge needed for advanced topics.
* <u>Resources:</u> See [[Support]], [[Support#General_Advice|General Advice]], [[Self_Support_First_Policy|Self Support First Policy]] and [[Please_Use_Search_Engines_And_See_Documentation_First|Utilize Search Engines, Documentation and AI]] for further guidance on obtaining help and becoming more self-sufficient.
