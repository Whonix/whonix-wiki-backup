{{intro|
{{project_name_short}} KVM maintainer availability is mostly limited to the [[#User Help Forum|User Help Forum]]. However, even there, user support activity is very low to non-existent. <ref>

Questions posted on Telegram, Matrix, IRC, Reddit, or other platforms (incomplete list) will most likely not receive attention from the {{project_name_short}} KVM maintainer.
