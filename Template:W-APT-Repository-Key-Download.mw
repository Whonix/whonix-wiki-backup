'''3.''' Users can [[Signing Key|<u>check</u> {{project_name_long}} Signing Key]] for better security.

'''4.''' Add the {{project_name_long}} signing key to APT's keyring folder. <ref>
Placing an additional signing key into folder <code>/usr/share/keyrings</code> by itself alone has no impact on security as this folder is not automatically used by Debian's APT by default. Only when an APT sources list configuration file points to folder <code>/usr/share/keyrings</code> using the <code>signed-by</code> keyword the signing key will be actually used. Therefore deleting keys in <code>/usr/share/keyrings</code> is optional if intending to disable an APT repository. See also {{kicksecure_wiki|

|text=APT Signing Key Folders
}}.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo cp ~/derivative.asc /usr/share/keyrings/derivative.asc
}}

'''5.''' Done.

The procedure of adding {{project_name_long}} signing key is now complete.
