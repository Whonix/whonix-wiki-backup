{{intro|
How much RAM does {{project_name_short}} need? 8 GB of RAM would be ideal for best usability and performance to run {{project_name_short}}. However, {{project_name_short}} can also be used with a lot less RAM. 4 GB of RAM is enough.

This wiki page provides advice on how to reduce RAM usage when using low-end systems with {{project_name_long}}, such as those with 4 GB of RAM or less. It includes instructions for reducing RAM and VRAM assignments, running {{project_name_gateway_long}} in CLI mode, and using graphical administration mode.
}}

= Introduction =
{{project_name_short}} {{cli}} is normally recommended for advanced users only. However, it is possible to reduce the RAM and VRAM (video RAM) assignment of {{project_name_gateway_short}} without requiring any other configuration changes such as package de-installation or configuration file modifications.

It is important to note that more RAM is required for upgrades.

{{project_name_gateway_short}} can function with as little as 256 MB RAM, but resource-intensive operations like upgrades can cause the virtual machine to freeze. <ref name=kernel-upgrade>
For instance, kernel package upgrades that rebuild the initrd.
</ref>

Assigning less than 512 MB RAM to a {{project_name_short}} VM will result in [[RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter|RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter]] launching the {{cli}} only, without LXQt {{gui}}.

Users with 4 GB or less RAM can temporarily assign 256 MB RAM to {{project_name_gateway_short}}. This is sufficient for the normal operation of {{project_name_gateway_short}} serving {{project_name_workstation_long}}. This process is described in detail below.

In version 18 (and above), to enable an unencrypted swapfile using swap-file-creator, follow instructions below.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mkdir --parents /usr/local/etc/default/swap-file-creator.d/
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=

== {{project_name_gateway_short}} CLI RAM Saving Mode ==
{{Box|text=
{{project_name_gateway_short}} initial first boot setup:
# Run {{project_name_gateway_short}} LXQt normally.
# Do not start {{project_name_workstation_short}} if you are low on RAM.
# Complete the initial {{project_name_gateway_short}} setup.
# Perform the system upgrade.
# Then, you can enable {{project_name_gateway_short}} CLI RAM Saving Mode to save RAM.
}}

{{Box|text=
To run {{project_name_gateway_short}} after its initial first boot setup or after upgrades:

# Shutdown {{project_name_gateway_short}}.
# Allocate less RAM to {{project_name_gateway_short}}: <code>Virtual machine</code> &rarr; <code>Menu</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code><i>Adjust</i></code> <code>Memory slider to 256</code> &rarr; <code><i>Click:</i> OK</code>.
# Assign less VRAM to {{project_name_gateway_short}}: <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>click a VM</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Display</code> &rarr; <code>Graphics Controller</code> &rarr; <code><i>Adjust</i></code> <code>slider for Video Memory to 16</code> &rarr; <code>OK</code>.
# Restart {{project_name_gateway_short}}.
# Start {{project_name_workstation_short}}.
# {{project_name_gateway_short}} is now serving {{project_name_workstation_short}} but operating with less RAM.
# To reconfigure or upgrade {{project_name_gateway_short}} later, use {{project_name_gateway_short}} Graphical Administration Mode as documented below.
}}

== {{project_name_gateway_short}} Graphical Administration Mode ==

{{box|text=
Follow these steps in order to upgrade {{project_name_short}} or change Tor settings:

# Shut down all VMs.
# Allocate default RAM to {{project_name_gateway_short}}. ([[Post_Install_Advice#Increase_Virtual_Machine_RAM|Increase Virtual Machine RAM]])
# Allocate default VRAM to {{project_name_gateway_short}}.
# Start {{project_name_gateway_short}}.
# The user will now have access to a graphical interface of {{project_name_gateway_short}} with LXQt.
# Perform administrative tasks such as upgrades and/or changing Tor settings.
# Shutdown {{project_name_gateway_short}}.
# Apply RAM Saving Mode as described above.

Done. The user has successfully upgraded or changed settings using a graphical interface of {{project_name_gateway_short}} with LXQt.

== {{project_name_workstation_short}} CLI RAM Saving Mode ==

{{project_name_workstation_short}} CLI can be run with as little as 256 MB of RAM when the LXQt desktop environment is not used. However, resource-intensive operations like upgrades can cause the virtual machine to freeze.<ref name=kernel-upgrade /> It is recommended to allocate more RAM, around 450 MB, during upgrades, which should be more than sufficient.

== {{project_name_workstation_short}} LXQt RAM Saving Mode ==

{{project_name_workstation_short}} LXQt can be run with as little as 512 MB of RAM. However, resource-intensive operations like upgrades can cause the virtual machine to freeze.<ref name=kernel-upgrade /> During upgrades, it is recommended to allocate more RAM, around 1280 MB, which should be more than sufficient. It is important to note that in this configuration, the VM might freeze due to low RAM, and certain applications, especially browsers like [[Tor Browser]], may experience reduced performance, particularly when numerous browser tabs are open simultaneously.
