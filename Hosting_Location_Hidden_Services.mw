Anonymous Hosting, Comparison Table of Tor Onion Services, VPN with Remote Port Forwarding, PageKite and Anonymous Third-Party Web Hosting Providers
}}
= Introduction =

This page discusses and compares the different kinds of hosting options utilizing location/IP hidden servers. It is possible to host anonymous services such as websites either:
* at home using Tor [[Onion Services]];
* at servers you physically own; or
* using (free) services provided by third parties, such as free <code>.onion</code> web space, VPS servers, web space, and so on.

The five most common methods of running location-hidden servers include: Tor Onion Services, using a VPN provider with remote port forwarding, local host tunneling such as [https://pagekite.net/ PageKite] (which makes your local host a server), <code>.onion</code> webspace, and via anonymous third-party web hosting providers.

An overview of these methods and a comparison table is provided below. Readers who are unsure of which method to use are recommended to review Tor [[Onion Services]], since they are the easiest to configure and provide the strongest anonymity.

= Anonymous Hosting Overview =

== Tor Onion Services ==

Onion Services provide a number of benefits. First, they are censor-resistant, which means that nobody can take the <code>.onion</code> domain offline unless they compromise the host and/or perform a successful flood attack. <ref>See [https://github.com/Attacks-on-Tor/Attacks-on-Tor Thirteen years of Tor Attacks] for a description of flood and other attacks against Tor.</ref> In addition, Onion Services are accessible over tor2web via HTTP, although this is not as censor-resistant as the <code>.onion</code> domain itself.

Onion Services are also free and do not require any registration to run (no sign-up is required). Further, they do not require any additional software other than the server software that will be run anonymously. Onion Services are flexible insofar as they can easily be run at home, on any server physically owned, or on (anonymous) third-party web hosting providers.

== VPN with Remote Port Forwarding ==

The level of censorship resistance afforded by VPNs depends on the specific provider used. While services will be reachable by a wider audience (clients) because Tor is not required, there are probably no free VPN services providing [https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/16627/does-portforwarding-present-a-risk-to-anonymity Remote Port Forwarding].

Unlike Onion Services, registration/sign-up is very likely required, which is a challenge to maintaining anonymity. On the upside, this configuration can be run at home, on any server physically owned, or on (anonymous) third-party web hosting providers.

== PageKite ==

[https://pagekite.net/ PageKite] is another alternative service which has been tested inside {{project_name_workstation_long}}, and is functional out of the box (although less tested by {{project_name_long}} developers).

PageKite is a subscription-based service, but it is free for Free Software authors; application for a free account is required. Further, it is necessary to comply with the [https://pagekite.net/humans.txt PageKite terms of service], register, and provide an (anonymous) [[E-Mail]] address.

Besides this entry, there is no documentation for pairing PageKite with {{project_name_short}}. However, it is relatively simple to use, and their service is well-documented; see [https://pagekite.net/wiki/Howto/PageKiteOverTor/ Running PageKite over Tor] and the footnotes. <ref>
* Instead of localhost, it is possible to use the {{project_name_gateway_long}} IP <code>10.152.152.10</code> and a custom port such as 9159, that is, replace <code>--torify=localhost:9050</code> with <code>--torify=10.152.152.10:9159</code>.
* Alternatively, the <code>--torify</code> switch can be dropped and the default PageKite GNU/Linux tutorial instructions followed, since "misc traffic" in {{project_name_workstation_short}} is automatically routed through Tor's <code>TransPort</code>.
* See [[Stream Isolation]] for an explanation of "misc traffic", custom <code>SocksPort</code>s, and Tor's <code>TransPort</code> in {{project_name_short}}.

{{IntroLike|
There are many so-called offshore or anonymous web hosting companies. Most of these hosting companies do not really offer anonymity because they usually require valid registration data (real name, etc.), forbid registration over Tor, and/or do not offer anonymous payment methods.

The ones listed in the following table are Tor user-friendly, accept anonymous registration, and can be paid anonymously with Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies.

= Conclusion =

Based on the preceding overview and comparison table, each method of running location-hidden servers has both advantages and disadvantages.

Tor onion services provide the greatest number of advantages. It is unnecessary to learn about and obtain anonymous money, which is a difficult endeavor on its own. Further, trust is not placed in third parties; you only need to rely on your own skills in setting up a server. Also, nobody can censor the server, and there is no registration nor limiting terms of service.

On the downside, if an adversary compromises the onion service, it is game over. This can occur via a successful attack against Tor onion services, the server software, and by breaking out of {{project_name_short}}. Onion services are also only accessible over <code>.onion</code> (visitors need Tor), and tor2web is not indexed by search engines. Finally, Tor onion services are only online as long as the server is online.

In comparison, a free (or paid) <code>.onion</code> webspace host can steal the domain at any time and take it over. On the other hand, it is unnecessary to worry about server security, and successful attacks against the Tor onion service will not lead to your location or IP address.

Finally, anonymous third-party web hosting providers involve anonymous money, which is difficult on its own. However, they can provide clearnet domains and/or the service can be used to host Tor onion services. Also, there is no concern about server security, and successful attacks against Tor onion services will not lead to your location or IP address.
