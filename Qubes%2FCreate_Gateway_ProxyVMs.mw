= Introduction =

This procedure is for advanced users who want the security benefit of separate {{project_name_gateway_long}} instances in {{q_project_name}}. While it affords some protection in the event other {{project_name_gateway_long}} instances are compromised, it will result in a different set of Tor entry guards unless precautions are taken.

Ensure the newly created <code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code> is based on the <code>{{project_name_gateway_template}}</code> Template and has a distinctive VM name, so it is not confused with other VMs. It is also recommended to <u>not</u> run multiple {{project_name_gateway_long}} in parallel, see [[Multiple {{project_name_gateway_short}}|Multiple {{project_name_gateway_long}}]].
