= Base Image =
Debian installer and or various desktop environments (GNOME etc.) might be using systemd-networkd and/or network manager (GUI) to set up networking. This might differ depending on Debian flavors and/or Debian installer options.

The Debian base config assumed in this developer documentation is a [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/blob/master/build-steps.d/1300_create-raw-image our minimal (grml-)debootstrap] created Debian image. These donâ€™t come with any network configuration at all. Using our minimal base image would have no networking configuration to begin with.

Someone who wanted to build {{project_name_long}} manually and from scratch would have to start with a minimal base Debian image. Not with for example a Debian Xfce installed with Debian installer DVD since that already comes with functional/different network configuration.
