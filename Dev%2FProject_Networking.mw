= Base Image =
The Debian installer and/or various desktop environments (GNOME etc.) might be using systemd-networkd and/or NetworkManager (GUI) to set up networking. This might differ depending on Debian flavors and/or Debian installer options.

The Debian base configuration assumed in this developer documentation is build-steps.d/*_create-raw-image, our minimal (grml-)debootstrap created Debian image. These do not come with any network configuration at all. Using our minimal base image means there is no networking configuration to begin with.

Someone who wanted to build {{project_name_short}} manually from scratch would have to start with a minimal base Debian image. Not, for example, a Debian LXQt system installed using the Debian installer DVD, since that already comes with functional but different network configuration.
