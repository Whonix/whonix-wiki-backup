== Present Advertisements ==
=== Power Up Privacy ===
[https://powerupprivacy.com/ Power Up Privacy (PUP)] is mentioned on the [[Donors|{{project_name_short}} Donors Recognition]] page as well as is (will be) mentioned in the page footer. PUP does not request special sponsors privileges on feature inclusion, changes, etc. The donation was given expressly to help the project. PUP does not wish to influence the direction of the project.

* Amount of influence: none
* Non-monetary contributions: none
* Hiring influence: none
* Writing code: none
* Suggesting features: none

PUP is also supporting other related projects such as The Tor Project, and Monero. This list is non-exhaustive. See the PUP website for further information.

== Past Non-Monetary Advertisements ==

The past list of advertisements includes:

* <u>Fosshost</u>: <code>fosshost.org</code> was a non-profit organization that provided hosting services to the open source community. Fosshost provided a stage server for {{Kicksecure}}.
* <u>Jobble</u>: link exchange. It shows advertisements for {{project_name_short}} for related searches.
* <u>Search engines (YaCy | Qwant | ecosia | MetaGer | peekier)</u>: This is a voluntary listing by {{project_name_short}} and no discussions have occurred with any of these services. Also see [https://forums.whonix.org/t/local-browser-homepage-for-tor-browser-in-whonix/347/101 this forum post].
* <u>Evolution Host</u>: provided system administration advice for the <code>{{project_clearnet}}</code> website.

These advertisements did <u>not</u>:

* result in monetary compensation for the {{project_name_short}} project;
* influence the direction of {{project_name_short}} development; or
* lead to changes in {{project_name_short}} software or website choices (apart from the advertisement itself).

When? Several years ago.

== Past Monetary Advertisements ==
* Time: 2018
* Where: Actually on the Whonix website only. Not on the Kicksecure website, which did not exist at this time. Why mention this on the Kicksecure website? See footnote. <ref>
For simplicity, to be able to maintain this wiki page as {{kicksecure_wiki

== General Sponsorship Policies ==
Last updated: 28 August 2024

This policy applies too all equally, sponsors, donors and advertisers.

# '''Separate Legal Entities:''' {{project_name_short}} always remains a completely separate entity from all donors, sponsors and advertisers.
# '''Non-Influence Declaration:''' All sponsors, donors, and advertisers explicitly acknowledge that their contributions, whether monetary or non-monetary, do not entitle them to ANY form of influence over the {{project_name_short}} project's development, direction, policy or governance. The {{project_name_short}} team retains full autonomy and makes all project decisions independently, without any external influence.
# '''Conflict of Interest:''' The project team is committed to maintaining independence and will take appropriate measures to ensure that sponsorships do not compromise the project's integrity.
# '''No Endorsement:''' Acceptance of sponsorships or advertisements does not constitute an endorsement of the sponsor's products, services, or viewpoints by the {{project_name_short}} project. Any advertisements displayed are for informational purposes only and do not reflect the views of the project or its team. [[Terms_of_Service#Non-Endorsement|Non-Endorsement]] policy applies.
# '''No Liability:''' The {{project_name_short}} project and its team members are not liable for any actions, claims, or damages resulting from the use of sponsor-related products or services. Users are encouraged to conduct their own research and make informed decisions when interacting with sponsored content.
# '''Sponsor Review Process:''' All sponsorships and advertisements undergo a thorough review process to ensure they align with the {{project_name_short}} project's values and do not conflict with the project's mission or legal obligations. Any sponsorships or advertisements that could potentially compromise the project's objectives will be declined.
# '''Compliance with Laws:''' All sponsorships and advertisements will comply with applicable local and international laws, including those related to advertising, data protection, and intellectual property. The {{project_name_short}} project will not engage with sponsors or advertisers that operate in violation of these laws.
# '''Termination Rights:''' Any sponsorships or advertisements that undergo detrimental changes AFTER the initial review will be promptly re-evaluated by the {{project_name_short}} team upon becoming aware of the situation. The {{project_name_short}} project reserves the right to terminate any sponsorship or advertisement at any time if it is determined that the sponsor's actions or products are inconsistent with the project's values, mission, or legal obligations.
# '''Indemnification:''' Sponsors agree to indemnify and hold harmless the {{project_name_short}} project, its team members, and affiliates from any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, or expenses arising from their sponsorship or advertising relationship with the project.
# '''Changes to Sponsorship Policy:''' The {{project_name_short}} project reserves the right to modify its sponsorship policies and practices at any time. Any changes will be reflected on this page and will apply to all future sponsorships and advertisements.

== Policy for Advertising on {{project_clearnet}} ==

* Just text and images
* Advertisements marked as advertisements
* No JavaScript or similar

This is only a consideration for a hypothetical future situation. Example: a VPN provider would offer sponsorship if {{project_name_short}} would provide a wizard for easily setting up VPN [trial] accounts.

* Non-default option
* Non-persuasive option
* Installing only Freedom Software by default (no non-Free, proprietary, nagware)
* Transparency about the partnership
* Maybe publishing scale of sponsorship (sum)
* Sticking to fair, nuanced, intellectually honest option about pros and cons
