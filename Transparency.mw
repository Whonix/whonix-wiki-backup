There is '''no sponsorship''' by any search engine provider.

There is a number of search engines <code>{{project_name_short_lowercase}}-welcome-page</code> and our wiki, which could be misinterpreted as endorsements. '''These are not endorsements.''' See also [[Terms_of_Service#Non-Endorsement|Non-Endorsement]] policy. They are simply suggestions. For more details, please visit our [[Search_Engines|Search Engines page]] to learn about our [[Search_Engines#Search_Engines_Criteria|Search Engines Criteria]], how we evaluate search engines, and how you can contribute.

=== All non-monetary sponsorships up to 2023 ===

The past list of advertisements includes:

* <u>Fosshost</u>: <code>fosshost.org</code> was a non-profit organization that provided hosting services to the open source community. Fosshost provided a stage server for {{Kicksecure}}.
* <u>Jobble</u>: link exchange. It shows advertisements for {{project_name_short}} for related searches.
* <u>Evolution Host</u>: provided system administration advice for the <code>{{project_clearnet}}</code> website.

These advertisements did <u>not</u>:

* result in monetary compensation for the {{project_name_short}} project;
* influence the direction of {{project_name_short}} development; or
* lead to changes in {{project_name_short}} software or website choices (apart from the advertisement itself).

When? Several years ago.

= Future Changes =

Any future changes will be documented on this page.

= Third-Party Policies =

== General Third-Party Policies ==
{{third-party-mentions-policy}}

== Policy for Advertising on {{project_clearnet}} ==

Largely hypothetical, since there are currently no advertisements and none are planned. Thanks to our amazing [[donors]] who support our project, there is no immediate need to host advertisements on <code>{{project_clearnet}}</code>. If there were any advertisements, the policy would be as follows:

* No targeted ads
* No tracking
* No spying
* No loading of web content from third-party pages
* Just text and images
* Advertisements marked as advertisements
* No JavaScript or similar

== Affiliate Policy ==

Largely hypothetical, since there are currently no affiliate partnerships and none are planned. Thanks to our amazing [[donors]] who support our project, there is no immediate need to pursue affiliate funding for {{project_name_short}}. If there were any affiliate programs, the policy would be as follows:

This is only a consideration for a hypothetical future situation. Example: a VPN provider might offer sponsorship if {{project_name_short}} provided a wizard for easily setting up VPN [trial] accounts.

* Non-default option
* Non-persuasive option
* Installing only Freedom Software by default (no non-Free, proprietary, nagware)
* Transparency about the partnership
* Maybe publishing scale of sponsorship (sum)
* Sticking to fair, nuanced, intellectually honest options about pros and cons

** https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TorPlusVPN
** https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Features#Tunnel_Support
* No marketing lies
* Wizard for easily setting up [trial] accounts
* Easily replaceable with other vendors
