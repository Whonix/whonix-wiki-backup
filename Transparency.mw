== General Sponsorship Policies ==
Last updated: 28 August 2024

This policy applies too all equally, sponsors, donors and advertisers.

# '''Separate Legal Entities:''' {{project_name_short}} always remains a completely separate entity from all donors, sponsors and advertisers.
# '''Non-Influence Declaration:''' All sponsors, donors, and advertisers explicitly acknowledge that their contributions, whether monetary or non-monetary, do not entitle them to ANY form of influence over the {{project_name_short}} project's development, direction, policy or governance. The {{project_name_short}} team retains full autonomy and makes all project decisions independently, without any external influence.
# '''Conflict of Interest:''' The project team is committed to maintaining independence and will take appropriate measures to ensure that sponsorships do not compromise the project's integrity.
# '''No Endorsement:''' Acceptance of sponsorships or advertisements does not constitute an endorsement of the sponsor's products, services, or viewpoints by the {{project_name_short}} project. Any advertisements displayed are for informational purposes only and do not reflect the views of the project or its team. [[Terms_of_Service#Non-Endorsement|Non-Endorsement]] policy applies.
# '''No Liability:''' The {{project_name_short}} project and its team members are not liable for any actions, claims, or damages resulting from the use of sponsor-related products or services. Users are encouraged to conduct their own research and make informed decisions when interacting with sponsored content.
# '''Sponsor Review Process:''' All sponsorships and advertisements undergo a thorough review process to ensure they align with the {{project_name_short}} project's values and do not conflict with the project's mission or legal obligations. Any sponsorships or advertisements that could potentially compromise the project's objectives will be declined.
# '''Compliance with Laws:''' All sponsorships and advertisements will comply with applicable local and international laws, including those related to advertising, data protection, and intellectual property. The {{project_name_short}} project will not engage with sponsors or advertisers that operate in violation of these laws.
# '''Termination Rights:''' Any sponsorships or advertisements that undergo detrimental changes AFTER the initial review will be promptly re-evaluated by the {{project_name_short}} team upon becoming aware of the situation. The {{project_name_short}} project reserves the right to terminate any sponsorship or advertisement at any time if it is determined that the sponsor's actions or products are inconsistent with the project's values, mission, or legal obligations.
# '''Indemnification:''' Sponsors agree to indemnify and hold harmless the {{project_name_short}} project, its team members, and affiliates from any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, or expenses arising from their sponsorship or advertising relationship with the project.
# '''Changes to Sponsorship Policy:''' The {{project_name_short}} project reserves the right to modify its sponsorship policies and practices at any time. Any changes will be reflected on this page and will apply to all future sponsorships and advertisements.

== Policy for Advertising on {{project_clearnet}} ==

* No targeted ads
* No tracking
* No spying
* No loading of web content from third party pages
* Just text and images
* Advertisements marked as advertisements

== Affiliate Policy ==
This is only a consideration for a hypothetical future situation. Example: a VPN provider would offer sponsorship if {{project_name_short}} would provide a wizard for easily setting up VPN [trial] accounts.

* Non-default option
* Non-persuasive option
* Installing only Freedom Software by default (no non-Free, proprietary, nagware)
* Transparency about the partnership
* Maybe publishing scale of sponsorship (sum)
* Sticking to fair, nuanced, intellectually honest option about pros and cons
