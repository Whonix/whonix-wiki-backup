{{intro|
{{project_name_short}} Wiki Comments Policy
}}
It was recently decided to allow reader comments on individual wiki pages. This change is intended to:

* Prove an easy mechanism for real-time feedback from users.
* Allow anyone to comment, particularly anonymous users.
* Provide a means of constructive feedback for wiki improvements, unless it becomes a burden due to spam.

Note: To discourage spam, restrictions may be placed on the posting of (unencoded) external links.

The wiki comments section is <u>not</u> intended for:

* User support. These requests will be redirected to the forums.
* [[Limitations_on_Free_Speech_on_Website_and_Chat|Free speech activism]].
* Immortalization: the posting of comment(s) does not grant the author a permanent publishing right.

[[Policy_of_Website_and_Chat#Usage_Rules|{{project_name_short}} forum usage rules]] apply.
