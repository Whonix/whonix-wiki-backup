Declined feature requests. Out-of-scope feature suggestions that are not on the {{project_name_short}} development roadmap.
}}

This wiki chapter relates to feature requests that have been declined by developers. There are several reasons for a request to be declined. In general, an impartial assessment determines it is incompatible with either the current project priorities, goals and/or policies. The [[Reporting_Bugs#Community_Feedback|Community Feedback]] wiki entry provides additional context and factors influencing decision-making:

* the number of existing, competing priorities and challenges to realize ambitious roadmap goals
* an existing backlog of unresolved, unaddressed bugs and feature requests
* limited development (human) resources
* existing developer priorities
* the time intensiveness or complexity of proposed feature requests

In simple terms, declined feature requests are not on the {{project_name_short}} roadmap and are unlikely to be considered in the future. This also means any voluntary contributions would be refused.

{{project_name_short}} community members should not be discouraged if a feature suggestion is declined. The {{project_name_short}} project will always remain highly receptive to genuine feedback and suggested improvements from users. For around a decade, {{project_name_short}} has prospered from community input and every suggestion will continue to be noted and carefully considered.

List of declined feature requests:
