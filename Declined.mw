__FORCETOC__
= Introduction =
Declined feature requests are out-of-scope feature suggestions that are not on the {{project_name_long}} development roadmap.

This wiki chapter relates to feature requests that have been declined by developers. There are several reasons for a request to be declined; in general, an impartial assessment determines it is incompatible with either the current project priorities, goals and/or policies. The [[Reporting_Bugs#Community_Feedback|Community Feedback]] wiki entry provides additional context and factors influencing decision-making:

* the number of existing, competing priorities and challenges to realize ambitious roadmap goals
* an existing backlog of unresolved, unaddressed bugs and feature requests
* limited development (human) resources
* existing developer priorities
* the time-intensiveness or complexity of proposed feature requests

In simple terms, declined feature requests are not on the {{project_name_long}} roadmap and are unlikely to be considered in the future. This also means any voluntary contributions would be refused and [[Premium Support]] is unavailable for possible implementation.

{{project_name_long}} community members should not be discouraged if a feature suggestion is declined. The {{project_name_long}} project will always remain highly receptive to genuine feedback and suggested improvements from users. For around a decade {{project_name_long}} has prospered from community input and every suggestion will continue to be noted and carefully considered.

This is not a comprehensive list.

* <u>Unsupported [[Host Operating System Selection|host operating]] system</u>: Some versions of [[Debian_Tips|Debian]].
** <u>Generic definition</u>: Debian <code>old-stable</code> versions are unsupported as soon as {{project_name_long}} was released for the current Debian <code>stable</code> version and {{project_name_long}} [[About#Support_Schedule|Support Schedule]] for the Debian <code>old-stable</code> version has been expired.
** <u>Current main specific definition</u>: Using Debian host operating systems (or its derivatives such as [[Kicksecure|{{Kicksecure}}]]) based on Debian version lower than <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian version short}}</code> (<code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code>) are unsupported.
** <u>Current alternative specific definition:</u> In other words, the minimum and recommended Debian version is <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian version short}}</code> (<code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code>).
* <u>Miscellaneous unsupported platform support</u>:
** [[VMware]]
** [https://forums.whonix.org/t/how-to-get-whonix-running-on-hyper-v/6741 Hyper-V]
** Parallels

** [https://forums.whonix.org/t/upcoming-usability-improvements-that-will-hurt-tls-downloads-abolishing-torrent-downloads/2099 <code>torrent</code> downloads]
* <u>Unlisted list entries</u>: If a {{project_name_long}} forum admin links to this wiki page, then this means the feature request is also declined but hasn't been added to this list here yet.
