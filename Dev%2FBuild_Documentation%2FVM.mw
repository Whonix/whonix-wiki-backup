Instructions to build {{project_name_short}} Virtual Machine Images from Source Code.
}}
= Introduction =
This page documents how to <u>build {{project_name_short}}</u> VM (<u>V</u>irtual <u>M</u>achine) images for [[VirtualBox]] ({{Code2|.ova}}) or [[KVM]] ({{Code2|.qcow2}}) [[Trust#Builds_from_Source_Code_versus_Builds_including_Binary_Packages|<u>"from source code"</u>]] using {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=Dev/Derivative-Maker
|text=derivative-maker
}}. Most users do not build {{project_name_short}} from source code but instead [[Download|download {{project_name_short}}]].

For [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_long}}]], see [[Dev/Qubes#Build_{{q_project_name_short}}_Templates|{{q_project_name_long}} Build Documentation]].

Building from source code has security advantages (see [[Trust]]).

The goal of this build documentation is to be usable by as many users as possible. Therefore written as easy as possible with no prior knowledge of tools used required.

The high level summary is:

# Host preparation.
# Get derivative-maker source code.
# Run derivative-maker.
# Done, build of {{project_name_short}} has been completed.

Advanced users that already know how to use <code>git</code> and how to perform digital software verification using OpenPGP (<code>gpg</code>) do not need to strictly follow this documentation. See footnote(s) for details. <ref>
For example, these instructions fetch only a specific git tag. If you know how to use git, you are of course free to <code>git clone</code> the whole repository and then use <code>git verify-tag</code>, <code>git verify-commit</code>, <code>git checkout --quiet</code> and <code>git</code> generally as per usual. The reason why more specific commands are being used on this page is to simplify the process for laymen, to make these instructions as fail-safe as possible.
</ref>

Due to digital software verification instructions and [[Software_Signature_Verification_Usability_Issues_and_Proposed_Solutions|Software Signature Verification Usability Issues]] these instructions might look more complicated then they actually are.

{{always_verify_signatures_reminder}}

Steps concerning digital software verification are pointed out as "This step is recommended for better security, but is not strictly required. (See [[Trust]].)"

When verifying digital software signatures, these instructions will be slightly more complicated but therefore even more secure.

# Host preparation.
# Get derivative-maker source code.
# Verify digital software signatures.
# Run derivative-maker.
# Done, build of {{project_name_short}} has been completed.

* <u>RAM:</u> You need ~ <code>4</code> GB free RAM.
** Might actually work with a lot less RAM.
** Might actually work with less RAM if you have swap.
* <u>linux user account:</u> Do not build under user <code>root</code>. Login regular as user <code>user</code>. Do not use <code>sudo</code> to run <code>derivative-maker</code> because becoming root when necessary is handled by the build script.

Unless you know what you are doing. Technically, it would work. This is recommended against. Those files would get managed by the respective package. When you later update {{project_name_short}} debian packages, your files would get deleted by the package manager. Also adding private files to {{project_name_short}} source code folder, later contributing to {{project_name_short}} development and accidentally pushing the wrong git branch would be a disaster. Better add your private files to {{project_name_short}} after building {{project_name_short}}. Or add a custom build step adding your files, which then get copied from a folder outside of {{project_name_short}} source folder. See "Source Code Changes" in "Optional Build Configuration" below.

<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
Building {{project_name_gateway_short}} and {{project_name_workstation_short}} at the same time is not supported due to limitations in the build script. In other words, do not try to run for example {{Code|~/derivative-maker/derivative-maker --flavor whonix-gateway -- --target virtualbox}} and {{Code|~/derivative-maker/derivative-maker --flavor whonix-workstation -- --target virtualbox}} at the same time. The build would probably fail.

= Choose Version =
{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt={{project_name_short}} default admin password is: changeme]]
| text    = Version Numbers Choice Information

'''1.''' Common sense is required when choosing the right version number.

'''2.''' For example, the latest available git tag version number is not necessarily the most stable or suitable. 

'''3.''' Follow the [[Stay Tuned|{{project_name_short}} News Blog]] as it might contain information.

'''4.''' This documentation will be using <code>{{VersionNew}}-stable</code> as an example. Replace <code>{{VersionNew}}-stable</code> with the actual version chosen for the build.

'''5.''' Git tags by convention:

* have one of the following appendixes <code>stable</code>, <code>testers-only</code> or <code>developers-only</code> version.
* For example:
** <code>{{VersionNew}}-stable</code>
** <code>{{VersionNew}}-testers-only</code>
** <code>{{VersionNew}}-developers-only</code>
* all represent the very same source code. <ref>
{{CodeSelect|code=
git diff {{VersionNew}}-stable {{VersionNew}}-developers-only
}}
</ref>

'''6.''' If there is only git tag <code>{{VersionNew}}-developers-only</code> available but a stable release announcement has been published, then there is no need to wait for the creation of <code>{{VersionNew}}-stable</code> since it actually has already been blessed stable, would contain the identical source code anyhow but just have a different git tag name.
}}

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt={{project_name_short}} default admin password is: changeme]]
| text    = Version Numbers Choice Instructions

'''1.''' Go to https://forums.{{project_clearnet}}/c/news/ and look for the latest stable version number.

'''2.''' Compare with the stable version number mentioned in the wiki.

'''3.''' For example, if <code>{{VersionNew}}</code> has been announced in the forums and is available from the wiki, git tag <code>{{VersionNew}}-developers-only</code> is avaialble but <code>{{VersionNew}}-stable</code> is not, then <code>{{VersionNew}}-developers-only</code> can be safely used.

'''4.''' {{project_name_short}} APT repository choice.

<u>Optional</u>. Enable [[Project-APT-Repository|{{project_name_short}} APT repository]] inside the images. <ref>

export DERIVATIVE_APT_REPOSITORY_OPTS
</pre>

<code>derivative-maker_apt_stable_release</code> defaults to <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code> and could optionally through a [[Dev/Source_Code_Intro#Build_Configuration|build configuration]] set to <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}-proposed-updates</code>, <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}-testers</code> or <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}-developers</code>.
</ref> See [[Trust]]. This is done for official {{project_name_short}} [[Dev/Redistribution|redistributeable]] builds.

{{CodeSelect|code=
--repo true
}}

'''5.''' Optional configurations.

<u>Optional</u>. See also [[Build_Configuration|Optional Build Configuration]].

'''6.''' Notices.

* These instructions assume you have the {{project_name_short}} source code in your home folder (<code>~/derivative-maker</code>), and
* use VirtualBox as an example.

'''7.''' Build a {{project_name_gateway_short}} virtual machine image. {{Code2|build command}}:

{{CodeSelect|code=
~/derivative-maker/derivative-maker --flavor {{project_name_short_lowercase}}-gateway-xfce --target virtualbox --repo true
}}

'''8.''' Build a {{project_name_workstation_short}} virtual machine image. {{Code2|build command}}:

{{CodeSelect|code=
~/derivative-maker/derivative-maker --flavor {{project_name_short_lowercase}}-workstation-xfce --target virtualbox --repo true
}}

----

While building, you might see a few [[Dev/Expected Build Warnings|Expected Build Warnings]].

= Build Logs =
'''Optional.'''

Mostly useful in case of build issues where sharing the build log is necessary for support.

If using:

* '''A)''' <u>GUI (graphical user interface):</u> It is recommended to set your terminal (for example xfce4-terminal) to unlimited scrollback, so you can watch the full build log and share it for support in case there are issues.
* '''B)''' <u>CLI (command line user interface):</u> In case there are build issues, it is recommended to redirect the build log to a text file. To do that, for example {{CodeSelect|code=
>> ~/build-log 2>&1
}} could be appended to the very end of the {{Code2|build command}} to redirect the build output to {{Code2|build log file}} <code>~/build-log</code>.
** Note: when using that command there will be no output in the terminal until the build is completed. This is as per Linux default and [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]]. The build might not complete. In that case, that command would hang forever. To see if the build is stuck, it would be possible to open the {{Code2|build log file}} with a text editor. In that case, the file would have to be re-opened or refreshed to with F5 key to see new build output appended to the build log file. Or by using for example {{CodeSelect|code=
tail -n 100 -f ~/build-log 2>&1
}}

= VM Build Result =

* <u>VirtualBox</u>: The resulting <code>.ova</code> images can be found in <code>~/derivative-binary</code> folder.
* <u>KVM, QEMU, raw images</u>: The resulting <code>.qcow2</code> and/or <code>.raw</code> images can be found in <code>~/derivative-binary</code> folder.

Most users have completed the build process at this point, can start using {{project_name_short}} and skip the rest of this page.

= Prepare Release =
[https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/developer-meta-files/blob/master/usr/bin/dm-prepare-release dm-prepare-release] is useful for:

* Creation of a [https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-virtualbox-14-0-1-4-4-unified-ova-downloads-point-release/6996 unified] <code>.ova</code> image or <code>libvirt.xz</code> archive
* Creation of torrent files.
* Creation of hash sum files.
* Creation of digital software signatures.
** [[OpenPGP]] (gpg) signatures
** [[signify|signify]] signatures
** [https://forums.whonix.org/t/use-codecrypt-to-sign-whonix-releases/7844 soon] {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=PQCrypto#Codecrypt
|text=Codecrypt
}} signatures
* Adding the license agreement.
* Adding the disclaimer.
* [[Dev/Redistribution|Redistribution]].
* Example: {{CodeSelect|code=
dm-prepare-release --build --target virtualbox --flavor kicksecure-xfce
}}

For private builds, i.e. for builds which are not supposed to be redistributed to others, none of this is important. If any of this was important, it could also be done manually.
