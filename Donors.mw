<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
* '''Start date''' : This recognition program started 2023-03-01.
* '''Minimum donation thresholds'''
** <u>Recognition:</u> '''$500''' is the minimum donation threshold, which can be a one-time donation or a cumulative donation since 2012. We would like to emphasize our gratitude towards all donors, regardless of their donation size. However, managing donation recognition incurs labor costs, so having a threshold in place is economically responsible, especially for honoring small donations. This is standard practice among even larger organizations collecting donations, as outlined on our {{kicksecure_wiki|wikipage=Dev/Donate|text=organizational donation considerations}} page.
** <u>Links and company logo:</u> '''$1,000''' is the minimum donation threshold for donors to have a link to their website on their recognition card.
* '''Privacy by Default''' : See [[#privacy-by-default-main-text|our policy about donor privacy]] atop this page.
* '''Preview''' : [[Testpage_Donors|See examples here]] for a demonstration how it would look like.
* '''Identity Recognition Choices''' : <code>none</code> {{!}} <code>pseudoymous</code> {{!}} <code>real name</code>
* '''Profile Image Choice''' : <code>none</code> / <code>provided image</code>
* '''Amount Recognition Choices''' : <code>hidden</code> / <code>range</code>
* '''Applications''' : If you, as an individual, or your organization or company wish to be recognized as a donor, please [[Contact|send an e-mail]] with proof of the donation. The proof of donation must include the donor's full name, the transaction ID, country of tax residence, and a choice of identity recognition (<code>pseudoymous</code> or <code>real name</code>), profile image choice (<code>none</code> or <code>provided image</code>), and amount recognition choice (<code>hidden</code> or <code>range</code>).
* '''Pre-approval''' : You are welcome to request pre-approval prior to donating if you have questions about whether you qualify for donor recognition.
* '''Disclaimer''' : Our [[Terms of Service]] and [[Policy of Website and Chat]] apply.
