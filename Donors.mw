! Start date
| This recognition program started 2023-03-01.
|-

! Status
| '''BETA''': Still in development. This program is not live yet but will probably be soon! {{testers-only}}
|-

|-
! Minimum donation thresholds
| '''$500''' is the minimum donation threshold, which can be a one-time donation or a cumulative donation since 2012. We would like to emphasize our gratitude towards all donors, regardless of their donation size. However, managing donation recognition incurs labor costs, so having a threshold in place is economically responsible, especially for honoring small donations. This is standard practice among even larger organizations collecting donations, as outlined on our [[Dev/Donate|organizational donation considerations]] page.<br><br>'''$1,000''' is the minimum donation threshold for donors to have a link to their website on their recognition card.
