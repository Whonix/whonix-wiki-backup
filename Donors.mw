! Minimum donation thresholds
|
* <u>Recognition:</u> '''$500''' is the minimum donation threshold, which can be a one-time donation or a cumulative donation since 2012. We would like to emphasize our gratitude towards all donors, regardless of their donation size. However, managing donation recognition incurs labor costs, so having a threshold in place is economically responsible, especially for honoring small donations. This is standard practice among even larger organizations collecting donations, as outlined on our {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=Dev/Donate
|text=organizational donation considerations
}} page.
* <u>Links and company logo:</u> '''$1,000''' is the minimum donation threshold for donors to have a link to their website on their recognition card.
