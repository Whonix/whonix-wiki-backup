Wiki History

{{intro|
Some wiki actions such as viewing the wiki history are only possible with a free account. This is to stop scraping robots from needlessly comparing every wiki page revision with every other wiki page revision on every wiki page.
}}

If you have a legitimate reason for crawling that is not already covered on the [[Offline Documentation]] wiki page, please post in the forums. In that case, please describe how that happened and include the URL from the browser address bar. For example,

<pre>
https://www.project_clearnet/wiki/Wiki_History?not-allowed=example-replace-me
</pre>

because it contains information to debug this issue, should this be a bug.
