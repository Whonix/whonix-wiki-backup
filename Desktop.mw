== Disable Terminal Emulator Banner ==
The following greeting banner appears when a terminal shell <code>bash</code> prompt is opened.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' {{Open_a__product_ws_terminal}}

'''2.''' Run the following command.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cp /etc/skel/.bashrc.{{project_name_short_lowercase}}-orig ~/.bashrc

== Shut Down {{project_name_short}} ==

To shut down {{project_name_short}}, open a terminal and run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo poweroff
}}

Alternatively, use the menu option:

* [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_long}}]]: <code>Blue Q button</code> &rarr; <code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code> &rarr; <code>Shutdown</code>
* [[Non-Qubes-Whonix|{{non_q_project_name_short}}]]: <code>Start</code> &rarr; <code>Leave...</code>

== Virtual Consoles ==
=== On the Host ===
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_console Virtual consoles] is a feature inherited from Debian GNU/Linux which is unfamiliar to many users. The following keyboard shortcuts activate the Debian (not {{project_name_short}}) feature:

* Text console: Press <code>Alt + Crtl + F1</code>
** Additional text consoles: Press <code>Alt + Crtl + F2</code> or <code>F3</code> and so on. Try these in case <code>F1</code> is not functional.
* Graphical console: Press <code>Alt + Crtl + F7</code>

=== Virtual Machines ===
{| class="wikitable"
|+ ''Virtual Console Activation''
|-
! '''Platform'''
! '''Steps'''
|-
! KVM
| The desired virtual console key shortcut can be selected under the <code>Send Key</code> option in a VM's graphical window.
|-
! Qubes dom0
| Qubes dom0 inherited the same feature (<code>Alt + Crtl + F1</code>...).
|-
! Qubes VMs
| In order to access VMs in dom0, run: <ref>
This is not a real virtual console, but using login.
</ref> <code>sudo xl console vm-name</code>. Replace "vm-name" with the name of the actual VM, for example.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo xl console {{project_name_gateway_vm}}
}}

|-
! VirtualBox
| The VirtualBox default is <code>Right Ctrl + F2</code>. <ref>
Inside VirtualBox, the <code>Alt + Ctrl</code> keys are already registered by the host operating system.
Host key can be changed using <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>Global Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Input</code> &rarr; <code>Host Key</code>.
</ref>

* Text console: Press <code>Right Ctrl + F2 (F1, F2, F3, F4...)</code> for one or more text consoles.
* Graphical console: Press <code>Host Key + F7</code> for a graphical console inside VirtualBox.

Due to technical limitations, an easier to understand presentation like <code>{{project_name_short}} username login:</code> or something similar cannot be shown. <ref>
The <code>login</code> program unfortunately does not provide this option.
</ref>

# Enter your username (this is most likely <code>user</code>) and press <code><enter></code>.
# Enter your password and press <code><enter></code>.
{{Default_Passwords}}

=== Banner Explanation ===
In the {{project_name_short}} case, the virtual console will show <code>host login:</code>. This can be confusing and has nothing to do with the actual host that {{project_name_short}} is running on. The string <code>host</code> is retrieved from file <code>/etc/hostname</code> which for privacy reasons is set to <code>host</code> in {{project_name_short}}. Therefore <u>do not</u> enter your host (the system {{project_name_short}} is running on) username or host password.

Due to technical limitations, an easier to understand presentation like <code>{{project_name_short}} username login:</code> or something similar cannot be shown. <ref>
The <code>login</code> program unfortunately does not provide this option.
</ref>

=== Login Instructions ===
# Note the [[#Banner Explanation|Banner Explanation]].
# Enter your username (this is most likely <code>user</code>) and press <code><enter></code>.
# Enter your password and press <code><enter></code>.

=== Disable Virtual Console Banner ===

This process is similar to [[#Disable Terminal Emulator Banner|Disable Terminal Emulator Banner]].

'''1.''' Open a [[#Virtual Consoles|virtual console]].

'''2.''' Run the following command to restore the original bashrc (untested). <ref>
Please leave feedback if this step works correctly.
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
cp /etc/skel/.bashrc.whonix-orig ~/.bashrc
}}

<ref>
Run the following command.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo unlink /etc/motd
}}
</ref>

'''3.''' Done.

The procedure is complete.

== Disable Autologin ==
Not very useful inside VMs, see also [[Protection_Against_Physical_Attacks#Login_Screen|Login Screen]].

This requires configuration of both GDM (old versions) and LightDM (newer versions) of {{project_name_short}}.

'''1.''' {{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/gdm3/daemon.conf.dist
}}

'''2.''' Search for the following.

<pre>
AutomaticLoginEnable=true
AutomaticLogin=user
</pre>

'''3.''' Modify.

Out-comment, add a hash symbol ("<code>#</code>") in front of the two lines. Or replace the content, copy/paste the following which does the same.

{{CodeSelect|code=
#AutomaticLoginEnable=true
#AutomaticLogin=user
}}

'''4.''' Save.

'''5.''' Disable LightDM autologin.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo rm /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/30_autologin.conf
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo rm /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/40_autologin.conf
}}

'''7.''' Reboot.

'''7.''' Done.

Autologin should be disabled after reboot.

== Disable Graphical Desktop Environment ==

== Use Full-screen Mode ==
It is recommended to work in full-screen; this feature is also inherited from [[VirtualBox]]. To activate and deactivate full-screen mode, press the VirtualBox Host Key + F. The current Host Key is visible in the bottom right corner of VirtualBox. The VirtualBox default is <code>Right Ctrl + F</code>.

Host key can be changed using <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>Global Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Input</code> &rarr; <code>Host Key</code>.

Full-screen mode leads to the {{project_name_short}} (and Debian) default resolution and color depth of <code>1920x1080x24</code>. Having a common value for these identifiers reduces the [[Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection#Major_Identifiers|fingerprinting risk]] to the user. Full-screen mode also helps to prevent users from accidentally launching applications on the host (such as a clearnet browser), instead of within {{project_name_short}}.

Before following these instructions to wipe the whole LXQt settings folder and restore defaults, it is recommended to backup existing LXQt settings.
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Open a [[Desktop#Virtual_Consoles|virtual console]].

'''2.''' Logout from and stop LXQt by halting {{project_name_short}} default <code>login manager</code> <code>gdm3</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl stop gdm3
}}

'''3.''' Delete folder <code>~/.config/lxqt</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
rm -r ~/.config/lxqt
}}

'''4.''' Delete the <code>first-boot-skel.done</code> file.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo rm /var/cache/anon-base-files/first-boot-skel.done
}}

'''5.''' Re-add {{project_name_short}} LXQt configuration files.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo /usr/libexec/helper-scripts/first-boot-skel
}}

'''6.''' Restart lightdm to restart LXQt.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl restart gdm3
}}

'''7.''' Done.

The process has been completed.

== Avoid VM Full Screen Mode ==

It is unrecommended to allow [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_short}}]] or other VMs to [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/how-to-enter-fullscreen-mode/ completely "own" the full screen]. Overriding Qubes' GUI virtualization daemon restrictions means the colored decorations drawn by each VM window will not be visible. In this case, a malicious application might not actually release the full screen (while it appears normal), or the full desktop may be emulated so users are tricked into entering sensitive information inside false "trusted" domains. <ref>https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/full-screen-mode/</ref>
