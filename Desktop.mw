== Disable Terminal Emulator Banner ==
The following greeting banner appears when a terminal shell <code>bash</code> prompt is opened.

== Shut Down {{project_name_short}} ==

To shut down {{project_name_short}}, open a terminal and run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo poweroff
}}

Alternatively, use the menu option:

* [[Non-Qubes-Whonix|{{non_q_project_name_short}}]]:
** In user sessions: <code>Start Menu</code> &rarr; <code>Log Out</code> &rarr; <code>Shut Down</code>
** In sysmaint sessions: click the <code>Shut Down</code> button in the System Maintenance Panel
* [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_long}}]]: <code>Blue Q button</code> &rarr; <code>Qubes Tools</code> &rarr; <code>Qubes Manager</code> &rarr; <code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code> &rarr; <code>Shutdown</code>

== Virtual Consoles ==
=== On the Host ===
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_console Virtual consoles] is a feature inherited from Debian GNU/Linux which is unfamiliar to many users. The following keyboard shortcuts activate the Debian (not {{project_name_short}}) feature:

* Text console: Press <code>Alt + Ctrl + F1</code>
** Additional text consoles: Press <code>Alt + Ctrl + F2</code> or <code>F3</code> and so on. Try these in case <code>F1</code> is not functional.
* Graphical console: Press <code>Alt + Ctrl + F7</code>

See also [[Protection_Against_Physical_Attacks#Virtual_Consoles|Protection against Physical Attacks, Virtual Consoles]].

|-
! '''Platform'''
! '''Steps'''
|-
! KVM
| The desired virtual console key shortcut can be selected under the <code>Send Key</code> option in a VM's graphical window.
|-
! Qubes dom0
| Qubes dom0 inherited the same feature (<code>Alt + Ctrl + F1</code>...).
|-
! Qubes VMs
| In order to access VMs in dom0, run: <ref>
This is not a real virtual console, but using login.
</ref> <code>sudo xl console vm-name</code>. Replace "vm-name" with the name of the actual VM, for example.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo xl console {{project_name_gateway_vm}}
}}

|-
! VirtualBox
| The VirtualBox default is <code>Right Ctrl + F2</code>. <ref>
Inside VirtualBox, the <code>Alt + Ctrl</code> keys are already registered by the host operating system.
Host key can be changed using <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>Global Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Input</code> &rarr; <code>Host Key</code>.
</ref>

* Text console: Press <code>Right Ctrl + F2 (F1, F2, F3, F4...)</code> for one or more text consoles.
* Graphical console: Press <code>Host Key + F7</code> for a graphical console inside VirtualBox.

Due to technical limitations, an easier to understand presentation like <code>{{project_name_short}} username login:</code> or something similar cannot be shown. <ref>
The <code>login</code> program unfortunately does not provide this option.
</ref>

# Enter your username (this is most likely <code>user</code>) and press <code><enter></code>.
# Enter your password and press <code><enter></code>.
{{Default_Passwords}}

=== Banner Explanation ===
In the {{project_name_short}} case, the virtual console will show <code>host login:</code>. This can be confusing and has nothing to do with the actual host that {{project_name_short}} is running on. The string <code>host</code> is retrieved from file <code>/etc/hostname</code> which for privacy reasons is set to <code>host</code> in {{project_name_short}}. Therefore <u>do not</u> enter your host (the system {{project_name_short}} is running on) username or host password.

The <code>login</code> program unfortunately does not provide this option.

=== Login Instructions ===
# Note the [[#Banner Explanation|Banner Explanation]].
# Enter your username (this is most likely <code>user</code>) and press <code><enter></code>.
# Enter your password and press <code><enter></code>.

=== Disable Virtual Console Banner ===

This process is similar to [[#Disable Terminal Emulator Banner|Disable Terminal Emulator Banner]].

'''1.''' If <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> is installed, boot into [[Sysmaint|<code>PERSISTENT Mode | SYSMAINT Session | system maintenance tasks</code>]].

'''2.''' Open a [[#Virtual Consoles|virtual console]].

'''3.''' Move the <code>/etc/issue.{{project_name_short_lowercase}}</code> file out of the way.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mv /etc/issue.{{project_name_short_lowercase}} /etc/issue.{{project_name_short_lowercase}}.bak
}}

'''4.''' Create an empty file in its place.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo touch /etc/issue.{{project_name_short_lowercase}}
}}

'''5.''' (Optional) Divert <code>/usr/lib/issue.d/20_security-misc.issue</code> to prevent the unauthorized access warning from being displayed either.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo dpkg-divert --divert /usr/lib/issue.d/20_security-misc.issue.bak --rename /usr/lib/issue.d/20_security-misc.issue
}}

'''6.''' Done

The procedure is complete.

== Disable Autologin ==
Not very useful inside VMs, see also [[Protection_Against_Physical_Attacks#Login_Screen|Login Screen]].

Autologin is enabled by default in the login manager by {{project_name_short}}.

See [[Login#Configuring_GUI_Autologin]] for detailed instructions on disabling autologin.
== RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter ==
{{RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter}}

For more information, see [[RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter]].

== Disable the Graphical Desktop Environment ==
This is for advanced users only.

To stop the graphical desktop environment.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl stop greetd
}}

To disable automatic start at boot of the graphical desktop environment.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl disable greetd
}}

To restart the graphical desktop environment.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl start greetd
}}

To re-enable automatic start at boot of the graphical desktop environment.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl enable greetd
}}

Do not attempt to uninstall the graphical desktop environment. This would require removal of {{project_name_short}} meta packages, and {{project_name_short}} meta packages [[Debian Packages#Packages_FAQ|are not designed to be removed]]. If you want a {{project_name_short}} server installation, download the {{project_name_short}} CLI version or build it from source code. See [[VirtualBox#CLI]] and [[KVM#CLI]].

== Use Full-screen Mode ==
It is recommended to work in full-screen mode; this feature is also inherited from [[VirtualBox]] and [[KVM]]. When full-screen mode is enabled, the {{project_name_short}} virtual display will automatically increase its resolution to the host system's resolution.

=== VirtualBox ===
To activate and deactivate full-screen mode, press the VirtualBox Host Key + F. The current Host Key is visible in the bottom right corner of VirtualBox. The VirtualBox default is <code>Right Ctrl + F</code>.

Host key can be changed using <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>Global Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Input</code> &rarr; <code>Host Key</code>.
{{Anchor|Whonixcheck / Timesync Writing to tty1}}

=== KVM ===
To activate full-screen mode when using virt-manager, open the VM window, then click <code>View</code> &rarr; <code>Fullscreen</code>. To deactivate full-screen mode, move the mouse pointer to the top middle of the screen, and click the <code>Leave fullscreen</code> button.

[[Undocumented]].

{{Anchor|LXQt Settings Reset}}

== Default Home Folder Configuration Files Reset ==
Before following these instructions to wipe the whole LXQt settings folder and restore defaults, it is recommended to backup existing LXQt settings.
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Logout from and stop LXQt by clicking <code>Application Menu</code> &rarr; <code>Power button</code> &rarr; <code>Logout</code> &rarr; <code>Yes</code>.

'''2.''' Open a [[Desktop#Virtual_Consoles|virtual console]].

'''3.''' Delete folder <code>~/.config/lxqt</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
safe-rm -rf ~/.config/lxqt
}}

'''4.''' Delete folder <code>~/.config/pcmanfm-qt</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
safe-rm -rf ~/.config/pcmanfm-qt
}}

'''5.''' Delete folder <code>~/.config/qterminal.org</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
safe-rm -rf ~/.config/qterminal.org
}}

'''6.''' Switch back to the login screen by pressing <code>Ctrl + Alt + F7</code>, then log in. LXQt will automatically regenerate its settings files as needed.

'''7.''' Done.

The process has been completed.

== Avoid VM Full Screen Mode ==

It is not recommended to allow [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_short}}]] or other VMs to [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/how-to-enter-fullscreen-mode/ completely "own" the full screen]. Overriding Qubes' GUI virtualization daemon restrictions means the colored decorations drawn by each VM window will not be visible. In this case, a malicious application might not actually release the full screen (while it appears normal), or the full desktop may be emulated so users are tricked into entering sensitive information inside false "trusted" domains. <ref>https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/how-to-enter-fullscreen-mode/</ref>
