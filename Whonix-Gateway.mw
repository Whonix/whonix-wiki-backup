{{intro|
The {{project_name_gateway_long}} is a software component that runs Tor, which moves data across multiple servers called Tor relays to keep users anonymous on the Internet, and it connects any virtual machine properly to the Internet using Tor only, while user applications should be run inside the {{project_name_workstation_long}}.

__FORCETOC__
= {{project_name_gateway_long}} Overview =

{{project_name_gateway_long}} is software designed to run [https://www.torproject.org/about/history/ Tor (onion routing)].

[[Tor]] is privacy-focused software <ref>https://www.torproject.org/about/history/</ref> that routes internet traffic through multiple servers and encrypts it at each step to provide maximum privacy. Tor was initially deployed in October 2002 as a decentralized network to be operated by entities with diverse interests and trust assumptions, with its code released under a free and open software license. Today, thousands of volunteers run computer servers that keep users anonymous on the internet by moving data across many Tor servers, called Tor relays. The final hop moves the data to the end site, making it hard to trace. For more information, see [[Why does Whonix use Tor|Why does {{project_name_long}} use Tor?]]

Every [[FAQ#What_is_a_Virtual_Machine.3F|virtual machine]] that is properly connected to {{project_name_gateway_long}} is connected to the internet using Tor and only Tor.

Applications like [[Tor_Browser|Tor Browser]] should never be launched inside {{project_name_gateway_long}}. Instead, all user applications should be run inside [[Whonix-Workstation|{{project_name_workstation_long}}]] to safely utilize the Tor network.
