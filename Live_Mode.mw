<div class="intro-p">
'''{{project_name_long}} has the boot option Live Mode''' - this means that nothing is saved and {{project_name_long}} forgets everything you've done after your session. This feature has been long requested and is very suitable for use cases involving sensitive data. {{project_name_long}} Live Mode is available for {{project_name_long}} as host OS as well as guest OS.

= Introduction and Definitions =

To use {{project_name_long}} without leaving any traces the feature '''live mode''' was introduced. In live mode the system can be used as normal but all data is lost and gone after the session. In sensitive temporary data use cases this is very beneficial.

{{project_name_long}} live mode is available for {{project_name_long}} '''as guest OS and/or if the host OS supports it'''. A '''host {{os}}''' runs directly on your physical hardware. A '''guest OS''' runs inside a virtual machine.

Terminology on ton this page:

* '''A)''' if live mode is available on the host OS we will use '''''HOST''''',
* '''B)''' if {{project_name_long}} is a guest OS we will use '''''VM GUEST'''''.

== Starting Live Mode ==

<div class="fontsize19">1. Boot your {{project_name_long}} VM ('''''VM GUEST''''') or power on the computer ('''''HOST''''')</div>

Restart / reboot if your system is already running.

<div class="fontsize19">2. Look closely at the Boot Menu</div>

The grub boot menu (read more about [[grub|grub bootloader here]]) will show your 3 options, the asterisk symbol [[File:asterisk_symbol.png|20px]] indicates the selected option. Read all options and analyse their meaning on a basic level. The "normal" mode is called '''persistent mode'''.

The three options are

* [[File:asterisk_symbol.png|20px]] <code>{{project_name_short}} GNU/Linux</code>
* <code>Advanced options for {{project_name_short}} GNU/Linux</code>
* <code>{{project_name_short}} Live-mode GNU/Linux</code>

'''What is the current selection?''' The current boot option selected is indicated by the asterisk symbol [[File:asterisk_symbol.png|20px]] and also by the white text color.

'''Can multiple options be chosen at once?''' No, at a time you can only select on option. The unselected boot options have NO asterisk at the front and a light blue text color.

<div class="fontsize19">3. To choose Live Mode use the arrow keys</div>

'''LIVE mode USER (For daily activities.)''' - to switch to this option zse the arrow keys (up ↑ and down ↓) on the keyboard.

<div class="fontsize19">4. Press ENTER</div>

Simply press enter after you've selected live mode.

<div class="fontsize19">5. Done</div>

Now the system is booting into live mode.
