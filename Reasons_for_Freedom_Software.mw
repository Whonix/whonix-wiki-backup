! scope="row"| Security
| {{Freedom_Software_Security}}
|-

! scope="row"| Legal
| {{project_name_short}} is based on [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html Freedom Software]. A lot of Libre licensed software prohibits modification and distribution without sharing the modified source code.
|-

! scope="row"| Ethics
| {{project_name_short}} developers believe it is immoral to benefit from those [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software Free]/Freedom Software components and give back nothing. We stand on the shoulders of giants - {{project_name_short}} and many other Libre software projects are only made possible because people invested in writing code that is kept accessible for the public benefit.
|-

! scope="row"| Community
| It is rewarding and enjoyable to have all types of people [[Contribute|contributing]]. This works best in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source Open Source] projects.
|-

! scope="row"| Impact
| When free in price, {{project_name_short}} can spread faster than commercial tools that cannot provide security by default/design.
|-

! scope="row"| Commerce
| Developers hope to make a living from {{project_name_short}} by selling additional services. ([[Plus Support]] | [[Premium Support]])

= No Intentional User Freedom Restrictions =
In the spirit of Freedom Software, {{project_name_short}} does not intentionally restrict user freedoms. {{project_name_short}} documentation might discourage certain configurations, but ultimately the user is free to ignore such advice.

In their default state, programs developed under the {{project_name_short}} banner may afford additional protection against unsafe user configurations. For example, even if users wanted to do things which are known security risk and recommended against, but documentation might still be provided on how to disable this security mechanism. Simply put, the end user maintains ultimate control over the final {{project_name_short}} configuration best suited to their needs.

Since [[About#Based_on_Debian|{{project_name_short}} is based on Debian]] it is valid to state that {{project_name_short}} has adopted a specific Debian configuration. For this reason advanced Debian users can independently replicate the same technical implementation. Anything {{project_name_short}} has pre-configured can be re-/de-configured by the user without restriction. User customization is not prevented by technologies used inside {{project_name_short}}, nor is configuration of {{project_name_short}} intentionally obfuscated.

Simply put, the end user maintains ultimate control over the final {{project_name_short}} configuration that best suits their needs.

= Software Fork Friendly =
{{project_name_short}} policy is that the name of the project should ideally be a variable so it can be easily changed through a software fork.

For example, {{project_name_short}} wiki markup text does not write <code>{{project_name_short}}</code> literally. Instead it uses variables such as [[Template:project_name_long|<code>project_name_long</code>]] which contains variable content <code>{{project_name_short}}</code>. By changing the contents of that wiki template to a different textual string such as <code>MyForkedProject</code>, the name of the project would change wiki wide from <code>{{project_name_short}}</code> to <code>MyForkedProject</code>.

This is also the reason why many packages names developed under the {{project_name_short}} umbrella contain <code>dist</code> (which is a generic abbreviation meaning "distribution") instead of <code>{{project_name_short_lowercase}}-</code>. {{project_name_short}} source code such as package names avoid using the literal string {{project_name_short}} as much as possible. [[Reporting_Bugs#Contributions|Contributions]] towards that effort are welcome.
