! scope="row"| Security

! scope="row"| Legal
| {{project_name_long}} is based on [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html Freedom Software]. A lot of Libre licensed software prohibits modification and distribution without sharing the modified source code.
|-

! scope="row"| Ethics
| {{project_name_long}} developers believe it is immoral to benefit from those [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software Free]/Freedom Software components and give back nothing. We stand on the shoulders of giants - {{project_name_long}} and many other Libre software projects are only made possible because people invested in writing code that is kept accessible for the public benefit.

| It is rewarding and enjoyable to have all types of people [[Contribute|contributing]]. This works best in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source Open Source] projects.
|-

! scope="row"| Impact
| When free in price, {{project_name_long}} can spread faster than commercial tools that cannot provide anonymity or privacy by design.

= No Intentional User Freedom Restrictions =
In the spirit of Freedom Software, {{project_name_long}} does not intentionally restrict user freedoms. {{project_name_long}} documentation might discourage certain configurations, but ultimately the user is free to ignore such advice.

In their default state, programs developed under the {{project_name_long}} banner may afford additional protection against unsafe user configurations. For example, users are unable to [[Tor_Browser/Advanced_Users#Running_Tor_Browser_in_Qubes_Template_or_Disposable_Template|start Tor Browser in Qubes' DisposableVM Template]] since this is a known anonymity risk and recommended against, but documentation is still provided on how to disable this security mechanism.

Since [[About#Based_on_Debian|{{project_name_long}} is based on Debian]] it is valid to state that {{project_name_long}} has adopted a specific Debian configuration. For this reason advanced Debian users can independently replicate the same technical implementation. Anything {{project_name_long}} has pre-configured can be re-/de-configured by the user without restriction. User customization is not prevented by technologies used inside {{project_name_long}}, nor is configuration of {{project_name_long}} intentionally obfuscated.

Simply put, the end user maintains ultimate control over the final {{project_name_long}} configuration that best suits their needs.

= Software Fork Friendly =
{{project_name_long}} policy is that the name of the project should ideally be a variable so it can be easily changed through a software fork.

For example, {{project_name_long}} wiki markup text does not write <code>{{project_name_long}}</code> literally. Instead it uses variables such as [[Template:project_name_long|<code>project_name_long</code>]] which contains variable content <code>{{project_name_long}}</code>. By changing the contents of that wiki template to a different textual string such as <code>MyForkedProject</code>, the name of the project would change wiki wide from <code>{{project_name_long}}</code> to <code>MyForkedProject</code>.

This is also the reason why many packages names developed under the {{project_name_long}} umbrella start with <code>anon-</code> instead of <code>{{project_name_short_lowercase}}-</code>. {{project_name_long}} source code such as package names avoid using the literal string {{project_name_long}} as much as possible. The development effort of changing legacy artifacts from for example <code>whonixcheck</code> to more generically names such as <code>systemcheck</code> is ongoing. [[Reporting_Bugs#Contributions|Contributions]] towards that effort are welcome.
