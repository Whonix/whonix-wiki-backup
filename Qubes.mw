In this configuration {{project_name_short}} runs on top of Qubes inside virtual machines (VMs), just like any other OS on the same platform (Fedora, Debian, Arch Linux and so on).

The Qubes bare-metal hypervisor is based on [https://www.xenproject.org Xen] and [https://getfedora.org Fedora]. Via  hardware support like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#Intel_virtualization_(VT-x) VT-x] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#I/O_MMU_virtualization_(AMD-Vi_and_Intel_VT-d) VT-d] Qubes has successfully implemented a comprehensive yet strict security-by-isolation architecture. Hardware controllers and multiple user domains (qubes) are isolated using separate VMs that are explicitly assigned different levels of trust, yet the desktop experience is user-friendly and well-integrated.

{{project_name_short}} is based on [https://www.debian.org Debian] and [https://www.torproject.org Tor]. The design provides a two-VM, split security architecture: an isolated [[{{project_name_gateway_short}}|{{project_name_gateway_long}}]] (ProxyVM; <code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code>) for complete routing of traffic over Tor; and [[{{project_name_workstation_short}}|{{project_name_workstation_long}}]] (App Qube; <code>{{project_name_workstation_vm}}</code>) for all desktop applications, which serves as a tailored OS environment for Tor-based privacy/anonymity.

To use [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_short}}]], Qubes must first be installed as a hypervisor on the physical host computer, followed by installation of the two separate {{project_name_short}} Templates -- <code>{{project_name_gateway_template}}</code> and <code>{{project_name_workstation_template}}</code> -- on top of Qubes. From this point, the {{project_name_short}} Templates can be used for customization and creation of multiple {{project_name_gateway_short}} ProxyVMs and {{project_name_workstation_short}} AppVMs, enabling enhanced compartmentalization of user activities for better privacy. <ref>The only limitation on the number of possible VMs is available disk space.</ref>
