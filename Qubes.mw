In this configuration {{project_name_long}} runs on top of Qubes inside virtual machines (VMs), just like any other OS on the same platform (Fedora, Debian, Arch Linux and so on).

The Qubes bare-metal hypervisor is based on [https://www.xenproject.org Xen] and [https://getfedora.org Fedora]. Via  hardware support like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#Intel_virtualization_(VT-x) VT-x] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#I/O_MMU_virtualization_(AMD-Vi_and_Intel_VT-d) VT-d] Qubes has successfully implemented a comprehensive yet strict security-by-isolation architecture. Hardware controllers and multiple user domains (qubes) are isolated using separate VMs that are explicitly assigned different levels of trust, yet the desktop experience is user-friendly and well-integrated.

{{project_name_long}} is based on [https://www.debian.org Debian] and [https://www.torproject.org Tor]. The design provides a two-VM, split security architecture: an isolated {{project_name_gateway_long}} (ProxyVM; <code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code>) for complete routing of traffic over Tor; and {{project_name_workstation_long}} (App Qube; <code>{{project_name_workstation_vm}}</code>) for all desktop applications, which serves as a tailored OS environment for Tor-based privacy/anonymity.

To use [[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]], Qubes must first be installed as a hypervisor on the physical host computer, followed by installation of the two separate {{project_name_long}} Templates -- <code>{{project_name_gateway_template}}</code> and <code>{{project_name_workstation_template}}</code> -- on top of Qubes. From this point, the {{project_name_long}} Templates can be used for customization and creation of multiple {{project_name_gateway_long}} ProxyVMs and {{project_name_workstation_long}} AppVMs, enabling enhanced compartmentalization of user activities for better privacy. <ref>The only limitation on the number of possible VMs is available disk space.</ref>

= Qubes Persistence =
Qubes (non-)persistence is a Qubes default and [[Unspecific|unspecific to {{project name long}}]].

= Qubes Template Modifications =
If a Qubes template has been modified, to make changes in App Qubes based on that Template take effect, it is required to shutdown the Template and restart the App Qubes based on that Template. This is a Qubes default and [[Unspecific|unspecific to {{project name long}}]].
