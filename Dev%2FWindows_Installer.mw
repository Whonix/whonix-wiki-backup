{{intro|
The Whonix Windows Installer was designed as a simple and fast way to set-up Whonix on a system running Microsoft Windows. 
}}
= Design / Features =
* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix-Installer
* https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix-Starter

WhonixStarter(.exe):

* new implementation of whonix.exe in lazarus (without NET framework)
* platform independent ( later linux/mac version possible )
* ui consists of two forms ( main & error )
* main form has two buttons for start/stop and manage Whonix VMs
* error form pops up if virtualbox is missing

WhonixStarterSetup.msi:

* installs windows version of WhonixStarter
* adds start menu entry
* adds desktop shortcut
* uninstall over Windows "Programs and Features" tool

WhonixSetup(.exe):

* ui consists of a main form with several pages guiding the user through the installation process
* platform independent ( later linux/mac version possible )
* installs VirtualBox and WhonixOVA
* executes WhonixStarterSetup.msi (Windows only)
* checks installed and only reinstall missing components
* does not uninstall or delete any component

Challenges:

* Whonix <code>.ova</code> is bigger than 2 GB.
* Windows <code>.cab</code> files have a hardcoded 2 GB maximum file size.

Requirements:

* cross compile on Debian (source) for Windows (target)
* building does not require Windows

Build limitations:

* needs Debian bookworm or above because of minimal wixl and lazarus version

== UseVersionInfo WhonixSetup.lpi ==

[[File:WhonixSetupVersionInfo.png|thumb]]

Can the following variables be removed if not essential?

<pre>
OriginalFilename="WhonixInstaller-XYZ-1.2.3.4.exe"
</pre>

<pre>
      <UseVersionInfo Value="True"/>
      <MajorVersionNr Value="1"/>
</pre>

<p>
The variables aren't essential for functionality.
</p>

<p>
For reasons of end user confidence it's recommended to keep the version and file information (<UseVersionInfo Value="True"/>).
</p>

<p>
"OriginalFilename" could just be "WhonixInstaller.exe". ( but I like to set the same as the final filename displayed in file browser )
</p>

<p>
"MajorVersionNr", "MinorVersionNr", "RevisionNr", "BuildNr" is summarized as "FileVersion" by Lazarus.
If we delete these values the file version will be 0.0.0.0
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure in this case if the version refers to the installer or the software being installed.

== Verification of Code Signing Process ==
=== Verification of VirtualBox ===
VirtualBox for Windows is signed using Microsoft {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=authenticode
|text=Authenticode
}} signatures ("<code>signtool</code>").

VirtualBox's digital signature can be verified on the Linux platform using <code>osslsigncode</code>. Example:

{{CodeSelect|code=
osslsigncode verify -in VirtualBox-*.exe
}}

A script [https://gitlab.com/kicksecure/virtualbox-windows-installer-binary/-/blob/master/verify <code>verify</code>] has been added to the <code>virtualbox-windows-installer-binary</code> repository as a reminder and example how to verify the digital software signatures on the Linux platform.

=== Signing Whonix Windows Installer ===
This document is based on a case where an executable (<code>hello.exe</code>) is signed using GitHub Actions (CI) and CodeSigner.

For more details on the test, please refer to this GitHub repository: https://github.com/adrelanos/codesigner-test

When a file (<code>hello.exe</code>) is signed, creating <code>hello_signed.exe</code>, the goal is to ensure that no additional modifications, beyond the signing process, have occurred. These could potentially include the insertion of malicious code.

Overview:

* Original file: <code>hello.exe</code>
* Signed file: <code>hello_signed.exe</code>
* Extracted signature file: <code>hello_signature.pem</code>
* File with reattached signature: <code>hello_with_signature.exe</code>
* File with reattached signature and reset PE header: <code>hello_with_signature_reset_PE.exe</code>
* File with removed signature: <code>hello_without_signature.exe</code>
* File with removed signature and reset PE header: <code>hello_without_signature_reset_PE.exe</code>
* [https://github.com/Kicksecure/developer-meta-files/blob/master/usr/bin/pe-header-to-zero <code>pe-header-to-zero</code>]

To achieve this, the original file is compared with the signed file in various stages and through different methods. The key stages are as follows:

1. Extract the signature from the signed file using <code>osslsigncode</code>:

{{CodeSelect|code=
osslsigncode extract-signature -in hello_signed.exe -out hello_signature.pem
}}

2. The original file (<code>hello.exe</code>) is then re-signed using this extracted signature to create a new file (<code>hello_with_signature.exe</code>):

{{CodeSelect|code=
osslsigncode attach-signature -sigin hello_signature.pem -in hello.exe -out hello_with_signature.exe
}}

At this point, one would expect <code>hello_signed.exe</code> to be identical to <code>hello_with_signature.exe</code>. However, it was discovered that the signing process (<code>osslsigncode attach-signature</code>) modified the PE header of the file by adding a PE checksum, thus resulting in a difference between these two files.

To analyze and understand these differences, a set of tools were used, including <code>diff</code>, <code>vbindiff</code>, <code>diffoscope</code>, and <code>readpe</code>. These comparisons brought to light the change in the PE checksum.

3. In order to make a direct comparison, the PE checksum in <code>hello_with_signature.exe</code> was reset to <code>0</code>, mirroring its original state in <code>hello.exe</code> and <code>hello_signed.exe</code>. This was achieved using a Python script named <code>pe-header-to-zero</code>:

{{CodeSelect|code=
pe-header-to-zero hello_with_signature.exe hello_with_signature_reset_PE.exe
}}

After running this script, the newly created file <code>hello_with_signature_reset_PE.exe</code> was found to be an exact match to <code>hello_signed.exe</code>.

4. The script <code>pe-header-to-zero</code> was also used on <code>hello_without_signature.exe</code> to create <code>hello_without_signature_reset_PE.exe</code>:

{{CodeSelect|code=
pe-header-to-zero hello_without_signature.exe hello_without_signature_reset_PE.exe
}}

It was found that <code>hello_without_signature_reset_PE.exe</code> was an exact match to the original <code>hello.exe</code>, further validating the process.

Following this thorough examination, it can be reasonably stated that the signing process did not introduce any unwanted or malicious modifications to the original executable file.

All operations were performed using the <code>osslsigncode</code> tool.

To install and examine PE headers, the <code>pev</code> tool was used:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install pev
}}

To view the PE checksum, the <code>readpe</code> utility was used:

{{CodeSelect|code=
readpe hello_signed.exe
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
readpe hello_with_signature_reset_PE.exe
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
readpe hello_without_signature_reset_PE.exe
}}

<pre>
Step 9 / 9 : Installing Whonix-Starter...

'''Debugging Attempt 1: Double Clicking WhonixStarter.msi'''

While this happened, user kept the Whonix-Installer open and then attempted to manually run <code>C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Whonix-Xfce-17.2.0.1\WhonixStarter.msi</code> for debugging reasons. Result:

<pre>
WhonixStarter

Another installation in progress. You must complete that installation before continuing this one.

Retry | Cancel
</pre>

What can we conclude from this? Maybe while Whonix installer is running, it cannot execute <code>msiexec /i "C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Whonix-Xfce-17.2.0.1\WhonixStarter.msi"</code> because it is blocking itself?

-> perhaps obsolete due to previous fix?
Strange: execution of "msiexec" is finnished when "Whonix-Starter could not be installed." appears.

''' Debugging Attempt 2: Starting WhonixStarter.msi from Terminal '''

Starting <code>msiexec /i "C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Whonix-Xfce-17.2.0.1\WhonixStarter.msi"</code> from terminal does not show any additional output.

== Claude AI based Code Review of whonixinstaller_main.pas ==
1) Resource management: While the code does free some resources, it's not consistent. For instance, in the FormCreate method, ResourceStream is created and freed, but in some other places like InstallationBuildIn, resources aren't always explicitly freed.

2) Potential infinite loop: In FormCreate, there's a while loop checking for disk space. If the user keeps selecting invalid directories, this could potentially become an infinite loop.

3) Unused variables: There are some unused variables in the code, like <code>filename</code> in the commented-out <code>EnsureValidExePath</code> procedure.

4) Inconsistent use of string types: The code mixes string and AnsiString types, which could lead to encoding issues.

5) Lack of input validation: When executing external commands, there's little to no validation of input parameters, which could potentially be a security risk.

6) UI responsiveness: The code uses Sleep in the SetNextStatus method, which could make the UI less responsive. Consider using a timer or async operations instead.

7) Incomplete implementation: Some methods like LabelCompleteDescClick are empty, suggesting incomplete functionality.

== ChatGPT AI based Code Review of whonixinstaller_main.pas ==
=== Cross-Platform Compatibility ===
The function <code>AppDiskGetFreeSpace</code> in <code>WhonixUtils.pas</code> seems to have platform-specific implementations, but it doesn't handle cases for platforms other than Windows and Linux.

<pre lang="pascal">
{$ifdef linux}
// Linux-specific code
{$endif}

{$ifdef windows}
// Windows-specific code
{$endif}

//cannot detect
Exit(-1);
</pre>

'''Solution:'''
Add support for other platforms or at least log an appropriate message when the platform is unsupported.

=== Missing <code>ApplicationName</code> Declaration ===
In <code>WhonixInstaller_Main.pas</code>, <code>ApplicationName</code> is used but not declared or initialized:

<pre lang="pascal">
UnpackPath := IncludeTrailingPathDelimiter(
  IncludeTrailingPathDelimiter(SelectDirectoryDialog.FileName) +
  ApplicationName);
</pre>

'''Solution:'''
Declare and initialize <code>ApplicationName</code>.

=== Thread Blocking Due to <code>Sleep</code> and <code>Application.ProcessMessages</code> ===
In <code>WhonixUtils.pas</code>, <code>Execute</code> uses <code>Sleep</code> and <code>Application.ProcessMessages</code> in a loop, which can lead to a blocking UI:

<pre lang="pascal">
repeat
  Sleep(100);
  Application.ProcessMessages;
  ...
until (BytesRead = 0) and not Running;
</pre>

'''Solution:'''
Consider using a separate thread for executing processes to avoid blocking the main UI thread.

=== Potential Infinite Loop in <code>CopyUnblocked</code> ===
In <code>WhonixUtils.pas</code>, the <code>CopyUnblocked</code> procedure might result in an infinite loop if <code>FromStream.Size</code> is less than 1024 * 1024:

<pre lang="pascal">
while FromStream.Position + 1024 * 1024 < FromStream.Size do
begin
  ToStream.CopyFrom(FromStream, 1024 * 1024);
  Application.ProcessMessages;
end;
ToStream.CopyFrom(FromStream, FromStream.Size - FromStream.Position);
</pre>

'''Solution:'''
Ensure that <code>FromStream</code> and <code>ToStream</code> are correctly handled and check the loop conditions carefully.

=== Potential Memory Leaks ===
There are several places where dynamically allocated resources may not be freed properly in case of an exception, especially in <code>FormCreate</code> and <code>InstallationBuildIn</code>.

'''Solution:'''
Use try-finally blocks to ensure that resources are properly freed:

<pre lang="pascal">
ResourceStream := TResourceStream.Create(HInstance, 'LICENSE', RT_RCDATA);
try
  MemoLicense.Lines.LoadFromStream(ResourceStream);
finally
  ResourceStream.Free;
end;
</pre>

=== Deprecation and Error Handling ===
Deprecated code comments indicate potential areas that might be out of date:

<pre lang="pascal">
// deprecated??? ---------------------->
if not InstallerForm.Showing then
begin
  InstallerForm.Show;
end;
// ------------------------------------<
</pre>

'''Solution:'''
Review and update the deprecated code.

=== Unchecked User Inputs ===
The method <code>SelectDirectoryDialog.Execute</code> assumes that the user input is always valid, which might not be the case:

<pre lang="pascal">
if SelectDirectoryDialog.Execute then
begin
  UnpackPath := IncludeTrailingPathDelimiter(
    IncludeTrailingPathDelimiter(SelectDirectoryDialog.FileName) + ApplicationName);
  ...
end;
</pre>

'''Solution:'''
Validate the user's input and handle errors gracefully.

== ChatGPT AI based Code Review of whonixutils.pas ==

1) Error Handling:

The Execute procedure has a try-except block that only handles and logs exceptions if Output is not nil. This could lead to unhandled exceptions if Output is nil.
pascal

<pre>
except
  on E: Exception do
    if Output <> nil then
    begin
      Output.Append('Exception: ' + E.Message);
    end;
</pre>

Consider adding a more robust error handling mechanism that logs errors regardless of the Output parameter.

2) Resource Management:

In EnsureExePath, TStringList is allocated but only freed at the end. If an exception occurs before sl.Free, there could be a memory leak.
pascal

<pre>
sl := TStringList.Create;
...
sl.Free;
</pre>

Use a try-finally block to ensure sl.Free is always called.

<pre>
sl := TStringList.Create;
try
  ...
finally
  sl.Free;
end;
</pre>

3) Platform Command Execution:

The Execute procedure uses different commands for Windows and other platforms to find executable paths. This can be simplified and made more robust by using Lazarus/Free Pascal's built-in utilities when possible.
pascal

<pre>
{$IFDEF WINDOWS}
Execute('where /r C:\ ' + filename, sl);
{$ELSE}
Execute('which ' + filename, sl);
{$ENDIF}
</pre>

4) Process Output Handling:

In the Execute procedure, handling of process output is done via pipes. This is correct, but you might want to ensure that both stdout and stderr are captured correctly by setting poStderrToOutPut.

<pre>
Process.Options := Process.Options + [poUsePipes, poStderrToOutPut];
</pre>

5) Possible Infinite Loop:

In the Execute procedure, there is a potential for an infinite loop if Process.Running never returns false. This can occur if the process hangs.

<pre>
repeat
  ...
until (BytesRead = 0) and not Running;
</pre>

Summary of Changes

* Added try-finally for TStringList creation and free in EnsureExePath.
* Introduced a constant CHUNK_SIZE for readability in CopyUnblocked.
* Encapsulated the Process creation and freeing in a try-finally block in the Execute procedure.
* Added a comment for potential infinite loop and suggested a timeout mechanism in Execute.
* General readability improvements and ensured consistent exception handling.
