{{intro|
{{project_name_short}} Project logos, profile images and banners. Graphics can be found on this page.

}}

= Definitions =

'''{{project_name_short}} Unified Design Logos''' are subdivided into:

* '''Standard Logo''': The base form of the image representing the whole project, often squared or almost squared.
* '''Landscape logo''': A wide version of the Standard Logo where the width is min 2:1 ratio of width to height
* '''Text logo''': A textform version of the Standard Logo which could be used in a text paragraph. Can be identical with Landscape logo if this is wide
* '''Icon logo''': A simplified version of the Standard Logo for cases where the logo needs to be very small. If the logo is already very simple this might be identical to basic Logo

'''Use cases''' where {{project_name_short}} logos will be typically used are:

* '''Profile image''': On various platforms there will usually be profile images which are used to identify the user. In most cases a square image will which be displayed as a square or a circle
* '''Banner image''': On platforms there will mostly be the option to decorate your profile with a banner image. This image is often wide with a 3:1 ratio or more
* '''Post image''': To create posts about {{project_name_short}} there will be an image needed to represent {{project_name_short}} as an OS as a whole. These images of often around a 16:9 ratio
* '''Favicon''': To identify your page in a Browser there are very small images called favicons displayed in the browser tab before the text. Those images are squared, very small, eg 64x64px or 32x32px and can have transparency

= Guidelines =

* Generally the images referenced in this page should be used on the different platforms. New images should be agreed upon with the {{project_name_short}} team
* The word "{{project_name_short}}" in text is always used with a starting uppercase letter. Only in the logos this might vary.
* '''Name structure for Logo images''' - apply only to images that fit one of the logo definitions above: <code>{{project_name_short}}-logo-definition.bmp</code>, for example <code>{{project_name_short}}-logo-standard-bimi.svg</code>
* '''Name structure for graphical components''' - apply only to graphical components (see chapter) that are used as parts to create other images: <code>{{project_name_short}}-component-description.bmp</code>, for example <code>{{project_name_short}}-component-background.jpg</code>
* '''Name structure for other images''' - apart from logos and graphical components other images should be named by the use case like so: <code>{{project_name_short}}-image-usecase.bmp</code>, e. g. <code>{{project_name_short}}-image-twitter-profile.jpg</code>

= Current {{project_name_short}} graphical components =

These graphical components are images or image components that can be used, combined and altered to create new {{project_name_short}} images for the specific use cases, namely for banners, profile and post images on varios platforms.

* Note: The last image is the background plate, currently in use for the banners.
* Note: Most files are in <code>svg</code> format. Often <code>png</code> format is available too by simply replacing <code>svg</code> with <code>png</code> in the browser URL bar. However, using <code>svg</code> should be preferred.
