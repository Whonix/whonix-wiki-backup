Documentation in the {{project_name_short}} wiki provides guidance on installing third-party software from different upstream sources. This is especially useful as upstream often includes generic instructions for various Linux distributions, which may be complex for users to follow. Additionally, documentation {{project_name_short}} usually has a higher focus on security, digital software signatures verification.

The instructions provided here serve as a "translation layer" from upstream documentation to {{project_name_short}}, offering assistance in most scenarios. Nevertheless, it's important to acknowledge that upstream software may undergo changes over time. Consequently, the documentation on this wiki might need occasional updates, such as revised signing key fingerprints, to stay current and accurate.

Please note, this is a general wiki template and may not apply to all upstream documentation scenarios.

Users encountering issues, such as connectivity issues, are advised to adhere to the [[Self_Support_First_Policy|Self Support First Policy]] and engage in [[Reporting_Bugs#Generic_Bug_Reproduction|Generic Bug Reproduction]]. This involves attempting to replicate the issue on Debian <code>{{stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}}</code> (over Tor), contacting upstream directly if the issue can be reproduced as such problems are likely [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]]. In most cases, {{project_name_short}} is not responsible for, nor capable of resolving, issues stemming from third-party software.

For further information, refer to [[Introduction#User_Expectations_-_What_Documentation_Is_and_What_It_Is_Not|Introduction, User Expectations - What Documentation Is and What It Is Not]].

Should the user encounter bugs related to third-party software, it is advisable to report these issues to the respective upstream projects. Additionally, users are encouraged to share links to upstream bug reports in the {{project_name_short}} forums and/or make edits to this wiki page. For instance, if there are outdated links or key fingerprints in need of updating, please feel free to make the necessary changes. Contributions aimed at maintaining the currentness and accuracy of information are highly valued. These updates not only improve the quality of the wiki but also serve as a useful resource for other users.

[[Contribute#Documentation|The {{project_name_short}} wiki is an open platform where everyone is welcome to contribute improvements and edits, with or without an account.]] Edits to this wiki are subject to moderation, so contributors should not worry about making mistakes.
