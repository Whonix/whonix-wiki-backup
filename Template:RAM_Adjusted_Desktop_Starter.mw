[[File:RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter created by adrelanos.png|400px|thumb|RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter will not start the desktop environment. The terminal-based {{project_name_gateway_long}} can be used instead.]]

By default, {{project_name_gateway_short}} VMs are configured with 1280 MB of virtual RAM. This can be reduced on systems with limited available resources.

* If total RAM is more than 512 MB, the default graphical <u>d</u>esktop <u>e</u>nvironment (DE) (Xfce) is started.
* If total RAM is 512 MB or less, the DE is not started.

This feature is useful for users with low RAM, as {{project_name_gateway_short}} can still function with as little as 384 MB of RAM.

If configuration or troubleshooting is needed, assigning 512 MB of RAM will automatically boot into the graphical desktop environment. Additional settings are available in the <code>/etc/rads.d</code> folder to configure this feature: more RAM can be allocated (while still opting not to start a desktop environment), different display managers can be used, and so on. See the <code>/etc/rads.d/30_default.conf</code> file for configuration examples.
