= Overview =

sdwdate-gui is an optional graphical user interface (GUI) for [[sdwdate]].

sdwdate-gui ensures the user knows whether network time synchronization has been completed, a critical factor for security, privacy, and anonymity. Ideally, after boot, users should wait with activities until sdwdate has completed. See also [[Sdwdate#Do_sdwdate_issues_impact_anonymity.3F|Do sdwdate issues impact anonymity?]].

sdwdate can optionally be configured to [[Network_Time_Synchronization#Block_Networking_until_sdwdate_Finishes|block networking until sdwdate finishes]], preventing potential leakage of the time before it is changed.
