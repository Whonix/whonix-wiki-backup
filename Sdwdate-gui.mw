= Overview =

sdwdate-gui is an optional graphical user interface (GUI) for [[sdwdate]].

sdwdate-gui ensures the user knows whether network time synchronization has been completed, a critical factor for security, privacy, and anonymity. Ideally, after boot, users should wait with activities until sdwdate has completed. See also [[Sdwdate#Do_sdwdate_issues_impact_anonymity.3F|Do sdwdate issues impact anonymity?]].

sdwdate can optionally be configured to [[Network_Time_Synchronization#Block_Networking_until_sdwdate_Finishes|block networking until sdwdate finishes]], preventing potential leakage of the time before it is changed.

= Troubleshooting =
== Qubes Specific ==
=== Denied sdwdate-gui.ConnectCheck from anon-whonix to sys-whonix ===

This might happen when the required dom0 <code>qvm-tags</code> are missing. The fix is to make sure <code>sys-whonix</code> has the server tag and <code>anon-whonix</code> has the client tag.

{{IconSet|h1|0}} '''In dom0:'''

Open a <code>dom0</code> terminal.

{{IconSet|h1|1}} '''Check sys-whonix tags:'''

Show which tags are currently set for <code>sys-whonix</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-tags sys-whonix
}}

{{IconSet|h1|2}} '''Expected output:'''

You should see <code>sdwdate-gui-server</code> in the list.

<pre>
anon-gateway
audiovm-dom0
created-by-dom0
guivm-dom0
sdwdate-gui-server
</pre>

{{IconSet|h1|3}} '''Add missing server tag:'''

Only needed if <code>sdwdate-gui-<u>server</u></code> is missing. This command is idempotent, so it is OK to run it even if the tag already exists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-tags sys-whonix add anon-gateway sdwdate-gui-server
}}

{{IconSet|h1|4}} '''Multiple gateways:'''

Repeat steps {{IconSet|h1|1}} to {{IconSet|h1|3}} for any [[Multiple Whonix-Gateway]], if any.

{{IconSet|h1|5}} '''Check anon-whonix tags:'''

Show which tags are currently set for <code>anon-whonix</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-tags anon-whonix
}}

{{IconSet|h1|6}} '''Expected output:'''

You should see <code>sdwdate-gui-client</code> in the list.

<pre>
anon-vm
audiovm-dom0
created-by-dom0
guivm-dom0
sdwdate-gui-client
</pre>

{{IconSet|h1|7}} '''Add missing client tag:'''

Only needed if <code>sdwdate-gui-<u>client</u></code> is missing. This command is idempotent, so it is OK to run it even if the tag already exists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-tags anon-whonix add anon-vm sdwdate-gui-client
}}

{{IconSet|h1|8}} '''Multiple workstations:'''

Repeat steps {{IconSet|h1|5}} to {{IconSet|h1|7}} for any [[Multiple Whonix-Workstation]], if any.

{{IconSet|h1|9}} '''Done.'''
