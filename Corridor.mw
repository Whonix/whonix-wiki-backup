Using corridor, a Tor traffic whitelisting gateway with {{project_name_short}}.
}}
= Introduction =
[https://github.com/rustybird/corridor corridor] is a Tor traffic whitelisting gateway. It is a filtering gateway, not a proxying gateway and can also be configured as a [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TorifyHOWTO/BridgeFirewall BridgeFirewall].

| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = corridor configurations are only possible in [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_long}}]]. [[Qubes|{{non_q_project_name_short}}]] is [[unsupported]] at present. <ref>[https://phabricator.whonix.org/T524 Corridor for {{project_name_short}} KVM ticket].</ref> <ref>Without third party contributions to corridor, [[Qubes|{{non_q_project_name_short}}]] is unlikely to be supported in the near future.</ref>
}}

It is possible to configure {{project_name_gateway_long}} (<code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code>) to use corridor as a <u>local</u> proxy to establish the following tunnel:<br />
<code>User</code> &rarr; <code>corridor</code> &rarr; <code>Tor</code> &rarr; <code>Internet</code>

This is not necessarily more anonymous, but it does provide an additional fail-safe -- a Tor traffic whitelisting firewall that helps protect against accidental clearnet leaks (hypothetical clearnet leak bugs in {{project_name_short}}). As [https://github.com/rustybird/corridor corridor's project description] states: "... it cannot prevent malware on a client computer from finding out your clearnet IP address."

corridor is mostly useful for developers and auditors of {{project_name_short}}, along with advanced users who would like to have an additional safety net. Note that it cannot protect from hypothetical bugs affecting Qubes' ProxyVM; a [https://github.com/rustybird/corridor physically-isolated, standalone corridor-Gateway] is necessary to cover that leak vector.

corridor does not increase the tunnel length, meaning no more relays are added between a user and the destination. Users interested in this configuration should read [[Tunnels/Introduction]].

== Warning ==

By default, the following instructions will result in:

# The [https://packages.debian.org/{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}/tor Debian tor package] being installed.
# Thereby automatically connecting to the [https://www.torproject.org Tor] public network.
# Downloading of corridor from [[Project-APT-Repository]].
}}
This behavior might be dangerous if users need / want to [[Hide Tor from your Internet Service Provider|hide Tor and {{project_name_short}} from the ISP]].

If {{project_name_short}} is already in use, then configuring a second running instance of [[Tor]] will ensure that it is independent of the one running inside {{project_name_gateway_short}} (<code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code>). From the ISP's perspective, the user will have a different network [[Fingerprint]]. The anonymity impact should be no worse than running Tor Browser, or system-tor and {{project_name_short}} at the same time.

== dom0 Setup ==
Create a new standalone ProxyVM called {{Code2|sys-corridor}} based on the Debian <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code> template:

<code>Qube Manager</code> &rarr; <code>Create new Qube</code> &rarr; <code>enable 'Standalone qube based on a template'</code> &rarr; <code>name: {{Code2|sys-corridor}}</code> &rarr; <code>template: debian</code> &rarr; <code>OK</code>

Enable the {{Code2|corridor}} qvm service:

<code>Qube Manager</code> &rarr; <code>left-click {{Code2|sys-corridor}}</code> &rarr; <code>right-click</code> &rarr; <code>Qube settings</code> &rarr; <code>services</code> &rarr; <code>type in the field</code> &rarr; <code>{{Code2|corridor}}</code> &rarr; <code>press {{Code2|+}}</code> &rarr; <code>press OK</code>

== sys-corridor Setup ==

If a BridgeFirewall is required, [[#Optional:_BridgeFirewall_corridor_Configuration|first configure Tor to use bridges]] before installing corridor. All the following steps should be applied in [https://www.qubes-os.org Qubes'] [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/templates/debian/ Debian template].

=== Install corridor ===

Start <code>sys-corridor</code> and open a terminal using Qubes start menu.

{{Project-APT-Repository-Add}}

{{Box|text=
Install <code>corridor</code>.

{{Install Package|package=
corridor
}}
}}

=== Configuration ===
=== Optional: BridgeFirewall corridor Configuration ===
TODO: BridgeFirewall corridor configuration is currently [[unsupported|untested]].

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = "Bridges are less reliable and tend to have lower performance than other entry points. If you live in a uncensored area, they are not necessarily more secure than entry guards." <ref>[https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-May/024378.html bridge vs non-bridge users anonymity].</ref>
}}

In order to use corridor as a [https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TorifyHOWTO/BridgeFirewall BridgeFirewall], configure Tor to use [https://support.torproject.org/#censorship_censorship-7 bridges] before installing corridor. <ref>The {{project_name_short}} [[Bridges]] page can help, but the steps do not apply one-to-one.</ref>
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Start <code>sys-corridor</code> and open a terminal using Qubes start menu.<br />
'''2.''' Create folder {{Code2|/etc/corridor.d}} and configuration file {{Code2|/etc/corridor.d/21-bridges-user.conf}} first. <ref>This skip is stepped if [https://support.torproject.org/#about_entry-guards Tor entry guards] are preferred.</ref> <br />
'''3.''' Create a bridges configuration file.
{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/corridor.d/21-bridges-user.conf
}}

'''4.''' Review {{project_name_gateway_short}} (<code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code>) [[Bridges|Tor bridge]] settings.

Depending on how Tor bridges are configured on {{project_name_gateway_short}} (<code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code>):

* if [[Anon Connection Wizard]] was used, see configuration file <code>/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/40_tor_control_panel.conf</code>.
* if [[Tor#Manual_Bridge_Configuration|manual Tor bridge configuration]] was done, see file <code>/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf</code>.

'''5.''' Add the following text. <ref>
https://github.com/rustybird/corridor/issues/42
</ref>

Syntax is similar as Tor configuration as reviewed in previous step. Replace the IPs and ports <code>1.2.3.4:443</code>, <code>2.3.4.5:443</code> with the actual IPs and ports of the bridges in use. All Tor bridges from Tor configuration on {{project_name_gateway_short}} (<code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code>) need to be added below too.

{{CodeSelect|code=
BRIDGES="\
Bridge 1.2.3.4:443
Bridge 2.3.4.5:443
Bridge 3.4.5.6:443
"
}}

Save.

'''6.''' Done.

BridgeFirewall corridor configuration is complete.

== Daemon Status Test ==
While these instructions remain experimental, it is advised to run the following systemctl commands to check everything is functioning correctly.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl --no-pager status corridor-data
sudo systemctl --no-pager status corridor-init-forwarding
sudo systemctl --no-pager status corridor-init-logged
sudo systemctl --no-pager status corridor-init-snat
}}

== Restart corridor ==
Reboot {{Code2|sys-corridor}}.

Do another [[#Daemon Status Test|Daemon Status Test]].

== Test corridor ==

=== Test Preparation ===

# Run the [[#Install_corridor|above systemctl commands]] again. <br />
# Create or use an appropriate existing AppVM named <code>corridor-client</code> (or similar).<br />
# Install / run either system-tor (from Debian or Fedora package sources) or Tor Browser.<br />
# Set <code>Networking</code> of <code>corridor-client</code> to <code>sys-corridor</code>. Tor should be still able to connect.

=== Testing Steps ===

Run a [[Tor#Log_Analysis|Tor log analysis]].

Then restart Tor.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo service tor restart
}}

Check if Tor is still able to connect.

To test Tor Browser:

# First check Tor Browser can make an initial connection to the Internet while <code>Networking</code> is still set to <code>sys-firewall</code>.
# Next set <code>Networking</code> to <code>sys-corridor</code> and confirm it is still able to connect. If so, that is a positive sign.
# Finally attempt an untorified connection by using an application like Chromium or Firefox browser. Untorified applications should fail to connect to the Internet.

== Test Logging ==
Whenever corridor blocks attempted actions (like the [[#Test_corridor|tests above]]), a message will appear in syslog. To inspect {{Code2|/var/log/syslog}}

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/var/log/syslog
}}

To check for blocks inside <code>sys-corridor</code>, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
}}

If corridor blocks anything, the output will be similar to this.

{{CodeSelect|code=
Jul 19 00:58:27 localhost kernel: [  954.706833] corridor:
}}

== Interpreting the Results ==
The safest configuration is only setting <code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code> to use <code>sys-corridor</code> for <code>Networking</code>. The reason is the [https://github.com/marmarek/qubes-core-agent-linux/blob/master/vm-systemd/qubes-update-check.service qubes-update-check.service] will try to use the Internet without Tor, and [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1814 other programs] may also try to use clearnet. Therefore, always shut down <code>corridor-client</code>.

== Configure {{project_name_gateway_vm}} ==
To set <code>Networking</code> of <code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code> to <code>sys-corridor</code>:

<code>Qube Manager</code> &rarr; <code>left-click {{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code> &rarr; <code>right-click</code> &rarr; <code>Qube settings</code> &rarr; <code>Networking</code> &rarr; <code>{{Code2|sys-corridor}}</code> &rarr; <code>OK</code>

The procedure is now complete.

= Debugging =
If problems are encountered, this section provides tips on gathering useful information for debugging.

It is also possible to ignore everything said on this website. Pretend it does not exist. Then [https://github.com/rustybird/corridor acquire corridor from its original upstream] and [https://github.com/rustybird/corridor/issues contact upstream for support].

Check if the {{Code2|corridor_relays}} ipset gets populated.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo ipset list corridor_relays
}}

It is recommended to also install the {{Code2|usability-misc}} package from {{project_name_short}} repository, since it provides the {{Code2|iptables-save-deterministic}} command. Alternatively, retrieve the package from [[Dev/Firewall_Refactoring|elsewhere]].

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install usability-misc
}}

Run {{Code2|iptables-save-deterministic}}.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo iptables-save-deterministic
}}

In Qubes, the output should be similar to the following.
