Use Signal Private Messenger over the Tor network with {{project_name_long}}.
}}
= Anonymity Specific =
The mandatory linkage of the desktop software application with a phone number makes it very likely adversaries can easily link any 'anonymous' use of Signal in {{project_name_long}} with a user's real identity, even if a secondary phone number is used as a limited workaround. Notably, to date Signal has ignored user requests to enable registration with an email account as a possible alternative. For this reason alone, alternative options like [[Chat#Gajim|Gajim]] and [[HexChat|HexChat]] should be investigated instead; see [[Chat|Instant Messenger Chat]] for further information. Readers are of course free to ignore this advice -- see below for {{project_name_long}} instructions.

| text    = It is possible to install the [https://www.signal.org/blog/standalone-signal-desktop/ standalone Signal Desktop application version] for Linux in {{project_name_workstation_long}}, and tunneling the application over the Tor network. However, this configuration is <u>not</u> recommended because although the traffic will be routed over the Tor network, Signal requires the user provide a phone number for verification. <ref>
The number can be different form the device's SIM card; it can be a landline or VoIP number, so long as the user can receive the verification code and possesses a separate device to set up the software.
