= Introduction =

It is safe to run <code>sudo apt autoremove</code> so long as the specific {{project_name_short}} machine <code>meta package</code> is kept for the {{non q project name short}} or {{q_project_name_short}} platform. In other words, these packages should <u>not</u> be in the list of autoremoved packages.

It is actually a good idea to safely run <code>sudo apt autoremove</code> according to the following instructions on this wiki page to make sure extraneous packages which might no longer be recommended for default installation are removed.

= Re-install Meta Packages and Safely Run Autoremove =

'''1.''' [[Update]] the package lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt update
}}

'''2.''' Ensure a proper meta package is installed. <ref>
The apt install commands are not strictly required if these packages are already installed. However, the simplest approach is to run these commands to follow the documentation as is.

* Either the packages are already installed: then the command does no harm.
* Or the packages are not installed: then these commands are necessary.

The alternative would require more extensive documentation, with a step like "check if this package is installed" followed by "only if missing, install it", but that would make the documentation unnecessarily bloated.

'''3.''' Auto remove packages.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt autoremove
}}

'''4.''' Reconfirm a proper meta package is still installed.

Repeat step two.

'''5.''' Done.

The procedure of safely running <code>sudo apt autoremove</code> is complete.
