= Introduction =

It is safe to run <code>sudo apt autoremove</code> so long as the specific {{project_name_short}} machine <code>meta package</code> is kept for the {{non q project name short}} or {{q_project_name_short}} platform. In other words, these packages should <u>not</u> be in the list of autoremoved packages.

[[Non-Qubes-Whonix|{{non_q_project_name_short}}]] Xfce:

* [[{{project_name_gateway_short}}|{{project_name_gateway_long}}]]: <code>non-qubes-whonix-gateway-xfce</code>
* [[{{project_name_workstation_short}}|{{project_name_workstation_long}}]]: <code>non-qubes-whonix-workstation-xfce</code>

[[Qubes|{{q_project_name_long}}]]:

* {{project_name_gateway_short}}: <code>qubes-whonix-gateway</code>
* {{project_name_workstation_short}}: <code>qubes-whonix-workstation</code>

It is actually a good idea to safely run <code>sudo apt autoremove</code> according to the following instructions on this wiki page to make sure extraneous packages which might no longer be recommended for default installation are removed.

= Re-install Meta Packages and Safely Run Autoremove =

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' [[Update]] the package lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt update
}}

'''2.''' Ensure a proper meta package is installed.

[[Non-Qubes-Whonix|{{non_q_project_name_short}}]] Xfce:

* {{project_name_gateway_short}}: {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install non-qubes-whonix-gateway-xfce
}}
* {{project_name_workstation_short}}: {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install non-qubes-whonix-workstation-xfce
}}

[[Qubes|{{q_project_name_short}}]]:

* {{project_name_gateway_short}}: {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install qubes-whonix-gateway
}}
* {{project_name_workstation_short}}: {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install qubes-whonix-workstation
}}

'''3.''' Auto remove packages.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt autoremove
}}

'''4.''' Reconfirm a proper meta package is still installed.

Repeat step two.

'''5.''' Done.

The procedure of safely running <code>sudo apt autoremove</code> is complete.

= Changed Configuration Files =

Be careful if a message like this appears.

<pre>
Configuration file '/etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.sdwdate'
Configuration file '/etc/apparmor.d/whonix-firewall'
 ==> Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.
 ==> Package distributor has shipped an updated version.
   What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
    Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
    N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
      D     : show the differences between the versions
      Z     : start a shell to examine the situation
 The default action is to keep your current version.
*** whonix-firewall (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ?
</pre>

For general advice, see: [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Changed_Configuration_Files|Changed Configuration Files]].

== Removal Instructions ==

These instructions allow for safe removal of a package (in this example the <code>uwt</code> package). This results in meta package removal without breaking the whole system when next time running <code>sudo apt autoremove</code>.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Upgrade.

[[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates|Upgrade the system]].

'''2.''' Clean up.

If custom packages were installed and uninstalled or dependencies changed in the meanwhile, remove unneeded dependencies first.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt autoremove
}}

'''3.''' Uninstall.

As an example, consider how the [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/uwt {{Code2|uwt}}] package could be uninstalled.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt purge uwt
}}

A message will appear similar to this.

<pre>
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:
  faketime libfaketime
Use 'sudo apt autoremove' to remove them.
The following packages will be REMOVED:
  qubes-whonix-workstation* uwt* whonix-shared-packages-recommended-cli*
  whonix-workstation-shared-packages-shared-meta*
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 4 to remove and 1 not upgraded.
After this operation, 302 kB disk space will be freed.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n]
</pre>

'''4.''' Keep packages installed by meta packages.

Now, there is a small issue:

* Next time the {{Code2|sudo apt autoremove}} command is run, all packages listed under "{{Code2|The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:}}" would also be uninstalled. (Such as {{Code2|[https://github.com/Kicksecure/rads rads]}} and others.)
* In order to keep the other packages which were installed such as by the {{Code2|whonix-workstation-packages-recommended-gui}} and the {{Code2|whonix-shared-packages-recommended-cli}} meta packages, mark them as manually installed so they do not get removed. This can be conveniently achieved with {{Code2|aptitude}}. <ref>
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/166590/what-is-the-apt-get-equvalent-of-aptitude-keep-all
</ref> <ref>
It is possible to safely mix {{Code2|apt-get}} and {{Code2|aptitude}}. Raphaël Hertzog, dpkg and Debian Developer, stated in 2011 that this is not a problem anymore:

<blockquote>First I want to make it clear that you can use both and mix them without problems. It used to be annoying when APT did not track which packages were automatically installed while aptitude did, but now that both packages share this list, there’s no reason to avoid switching back and forth.</blockquote>

</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo aptitude keep-all
}}

'''5.''' Done.

The procedure is complete. Be sure to understand the [[#Disadvantage|disadvantage]] of this approach.
