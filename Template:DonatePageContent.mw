In a world of government surveillance and corporate mass data collection the ability to protect your privacy is more important and more difficult than ever before. True options are very limited. '''Founded 10 years ago {{project_name_long}} is such an option and one of the best privacy and anonymity operating systems for desktop in the world. And the most watertight among them!'''

{{project_name_long}} can anonymize everything you do online and defeats common attacks and privacy threats to users and servers. It is the only actively developed OS designed to be run inside a VM and paired with Tor anonymity software - with a 10 years history!

Best of all {{project_name_long}} is a free and open-source. Thanks to our patrons we stay free from corporate and government influence. '''But we need your support to keep this great project running. Donate now to keep {{project_name_long}} alive!'''
