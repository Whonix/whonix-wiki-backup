===== Development =====
Just start working on [https://phabricator.{{project_clearnet}}/maniphest/query/open/ any open ticket]. One example ticket:<br />
https://forums.whonix.org/t/screen-locker-in-security-can-we-disable-these-at-least-4-backdoors/8128/3

Or start by working on any of these [https://forums.whonix.org/search?expanded=true&q=%23status_open_issue_todo%20%23component_security security TODO] items.

==== Contributor List ====
{{Contributor_List}}

{{Anchor|Maintainer}}
{{Anchor|Contributor}}

{{Anchor|Contributor}}
==== Contributor Responsibilities ====
The tasks of a contributor include:

* Answering questions in the forums.
* Keeping the wiki up-to-date.
* Testing of installation, build and upgrade instructions.
* Following the [[Reporting_Bugs#Issue_Tracker|issue tracker]], squashing bugs and perhaps implementing new features relating to the maintained component.
* Otherwise self-initiated (guess) work and taking care of the [[#Contributor List|component]] in question.

This is a volunteer position.

==== Package Contributor ====
{{project_name_short}} provides a lot of Debian packages; see [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}} Overview] for further information. Due to limited [[Contributors|{{project_name_short}} contributors]] resources, only [[Packages for Debian Hosts|a few]] packages are supported on Debian hosts. A lot of these packages are [[Other_Operating_Systems#{{project_name_short}}_Packages|untested and unmaintained]] in any other Linux distribution.

Would you be interested in maintaining one or more packages for use beyond {{project_name_short}}? For example, in Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora or other distributions? Maintenance requirements would involve keeping up with code changes and releases, testing if these packages work outside of {{project_name_short}}, eventually reporting bugs or adding new features, and answering user support requests.

If interested, ambitious package contributors could even seek to have one or more {{project_name_short}} packages accepted into a mainstream Linux distribution.

This is a volunteer position.

==== General Tasks ====
People with skills and interest in the following areas would also help:

* Good knowledge of Linux networking and iptables.
* AppArmor profile creation and testing of new [[AppArmor]] profiles for improved security.
* {{Code2|#!/bin/bash}}
* Programming languages like Python, Ruby, C, and others.
* Registration at our [[Reporting_Bugs#Issue_Tracker|issue tracker]].
* Participation in the [https://forums.{{project_clearnet}}/c/development development forum]; consider hitting the "notify" button to subscribe.
* Discussion participation - login on github and go to https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/derivative-maker/issues and press "watch" for notifications about {{project_name_short}} github issues (this is an old issue tracker and less important).

=== Release Manager ===
If you are willing to have your real name connected to the {{project_name_short}} project and Tor, please continue reading.

Depending on your interests, your tasks could include:

* Building {{project_name_short}} .ova images:
** Creating stable releases.
** Creating stable hotfix releases.
** Creating assorted other builds. <ref>
** Creating {{project_name_short}} CLI builds.
** Creating testers-only releases.
** Creating {{project_name_short}}-Gnome-Workstation.
** Creating {{project_name_short}}-LXDE-Workstation.
** Creating 64-bit builds.
</ref>
* Building {{project_name_short}} .libvirt images.
* Reporting bugs when builds fail.
* Signing and uploading releases.
* Updating the download page.
* Posting to the blog or mailing lists.
* Fixing simple build documentation.
* [[Dev/Redistribution]]
* [[Essential_Tests|Essential {{project_name_short}} Functionality Tests]]. <ref>
This will be easy and fast as soon as we add a script.
