'''TODO: Please help test and improve these instructions.'''

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Edit the network interfaces file.

* Standard-[[Download|{{project_name_short}}]]-Version (VM) users: Edit ''/etc/network/interfaces'' on the host.
* [[Dev/Build_Documentation/Physical_Isolation|Physical Isolation]] users: Edit ''/etc/network/interfaces'' on {{project_name_gateway_short}}.

'''2.''' Install macchanger.

In a terminal, run:

{{CodeSelect|code=
su
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
apt update && apt install macchanger
}}

'''3.''' Change the MAC address.

{{mbox
| type      = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = The following steps manually change the MAC address for a device. An example is provided for a wireless device (<code>wlan0</code>). Replace <code>wlan0</code> with the appropriate device, such as an ethernet device (<code>eth0</code>).
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
su
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
ifconfig wlan0 down
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
macchanger -a wlan0
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
ifconfig wlan0 up
}}

If the steps above do not work, the following method might work without macchanger. Replace <code>wlan0</code> with the correct device name.

{{CodeSelect|code=
su
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
ifconfig wlan0 down
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
ifconfig wlan0 up
}}

Alternatively, use iproute2 commands to change the MAC address.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ip link set down wlan0
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
ip link set wlan0 address 00:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
ip link set up wlan0
}}

'''4.''' Complete the MAC address change.

Below <code>iface eth0 inet dhcp</code>, add:

{{CodeSelect|code=
hwaddress ether 00:00....
}}

'''5.''' ''Optional:'' Automatically randomize the MAC address on boot.

To enable this, add:

{{CodeSelect|code=
pre-up macchanger -e eth0
}}

'''6.''' Modify network interface settings.

To prevent new network interfaces from being automatically activated, comment out the following line:

{{CodeSelect|code=
auto eth0
}}

Then, configure manual activation with:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo ifup eth0
}}
}}
