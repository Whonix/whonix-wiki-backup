! Difficulty
|
* Downloading a new {{project_name_gateway_long}} / {{project_name_workstation_long}} ([[Factory Reset]]) is easier than applying the [[Release Upgrade|Release Upgrade]] instructions on this page.
* Debian release notes: TODO: update links
** [https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/amd64/release-notes/ch-upgrading.en.html Chapter 4. Upgrades from Debian 12 (trixie)]
** [https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/amd64/release-notes/ch-information Chapter 5. Issues to be aware of for trixie]

! Release Upgrade vs Re-Installation
|
To use [[About|{{project_name_short}}]] 18, users can either:

* '''A)''' Release upgrade existing {{project_name_short}} 17 images using the instructions on this page; <u>OR</u>
* '''B)''' Factory Reset using the {{project_name_short}} re-install method by downloading the new release, which is much simpler than upgrading:
** [[{{non_q_project_name_short}}|{{non_q_project_name_short}}]] 18: [[Download|download the new release]].
** [[{{q_project_name_short}}|{{q_project_name_long}}]] 18: [[Qubes/Install|download the new release]].
|-

! Standard Updates
|
* For standard ("everyday") update instructions see [[Operating System Software and Updates]]. <br />
* The instructions on this page describe how to perform a [[Release Upgrade]] from {{project_name_short}} 17 to {{project_name_short}} 18.
|-

! Automated Release Upgrade vs Manual Release Upgrade
|
* [[#Release Upgrade|Automated Release Upgrade]] is the newer method that has been implemented. It does not ask for user input and is therefore easier to use.
* The former Manual Release Upgrade effectively did the same, but it offered more control over system customization. It is now [[Deprecated#Manual Release Upgrade|deprecated]]. <ref>
This method is still possible. All the automated {{Github_link|repo=legacy-dist|path=/blob/master/usr/sbin/release-upgrade|text=<code>release-upgrade</code>}} script does is perform actions which the user could perform manually. If a manual release upgrade is desired, emulate what the <code>release-upgrade</code> script is doing. The manual release upgrading procedure is [[Unsupported|undocumented]] due to the size of the instructions and duplication involved.

|-

! Configuration Files Resets
| Since this is an automated release upgrade, user modified configuration files (if any) in folder <code>/etc</code> will be reset, overwritten with the Debian or {{project_name_short}} package version. The user is free to restore the configuration after the release upgrade.

= Release Upgrade =

# Backup all data, ideally have a clone of the VM(s) so it is possible to try again (if necessary).
# Perform the usual [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Standard_Upgrade_Steps|standard ("everyday") update instructions]].
# Consider running the optional [[#Sanity Tests|sanity tests]].
# Run {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=systemcheck
|text=systemcheck
}}.
# View <code>release-upgrade</code> command version: {{CodeSelect|inline=true|code=
cat /usr/sbin/release-upgrade {{!}} grep version=
}}
# Check <code>release-upgrade</code> command version. It should be a minimum of <code>3.3</code>, and display <code>version="3.3"</code>.
# Consider keeping the full release upgrade log output. It will be required for [[Support]] in case there are issues.
# Perform the automated [[Release Upgrade|release upgrade]] using the <code>release-upgrade</code> command: {{CodeSelect|inline=true|code=
sudo release-upgrade
}}
# Re-run the [[APT_Repository|repository-dist]] utility to update your derivative APT sources list from the old <code>.list</code> to the new <code>.sources</code> format. <ref>
https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/apt-sources-list-one-line-format-versus-deb822-style-format/267
</ref> This is a very minor issue if forgotten. It can be done at any later time. [[systemcheck]] will point this out if it has not been done yet.
# Done. If everything went well, at the end it will show: <blockquote>INFO: OK. (release-upgrade version: 3.3) Release upgrade success.</blockquote>
# Reboot.
# Optional, recommended: [[Debian_Packages|Re-install Meta Packages and Safely Run Autoremove]]
