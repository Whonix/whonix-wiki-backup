Information about onion-grater.

= Introduction =

onion-grater is a filter proxy that denies every controller command by default and allow specific commands, arguments and events that are explicitly whitelisted. It is a Tails project forked by {{project_name_long}} with some adaptations.

Acts as a proxy between the client application and Tor:

* Filters out Tor control protocol commands that are dangerous for anonymity such as <code>GETINFO ADDRESS</code> using a whitelist. 
* Allows using Tor Browser's New Identity feature on Anonymity Distribution Workstations.
* Fixes Tor Browser's about:tor default homepage and Tor Button status indicator without exposing commands that are dangerous for anonymity.
