For greater system security, it is strongly recommended to avoid installing unsigned software. Always make sure that [[Verifying_Software_Signatures|signing keys and signatures are correct]] and/or use mechanisms that heavily simplify and automate this process, like [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Updates|apt upgrades]].

As a reminder, digital signatures are not a magic bullet. While they increase the certainty that no backdoor was introduced by a third party during transit, this does not mean the software is absolutely "backdoor-free". Learn more about this process and [[Verifying_Software_Signatures#What_Digital_Signatures_Prove|what digital signatures prove]].
