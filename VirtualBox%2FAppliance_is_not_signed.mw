{{project_name_short}} does not use this signing mechanism and nobody else is known to use it either. [https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=94327#p455421 VirtualBox provides neither documentation on how to use this feature nor a tool to use this feature.] The provided OpenPGP signatures are a more complete and secure replacement of this feature.
