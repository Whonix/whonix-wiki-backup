{{intro|
{{project_name_short}} specific sysmaint account documentation. Default Installation Status Differences:

* Whonix-Workstation versus Whonix-Gateway; 
* GUI (Xfce) versus CLI;
* Older versions versus new images.

Starting from {{project_name_workstation_short}} version <code>17.3.9.9</code> Xfce and above, {{project_name_short}} comes with [[sysmaint|<code>user-sysmaint-split</code>]] by default.

There are two accounts:

* <code>user</code> - For daily activities.
* <code>sysmaint</code> - For system maintenance administrative activities, such as installing software or upgrading.

This is a security feature. ({{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=Root#Rationale_for_Separate_sysmaint_Account
|text=rationale
}})

The opposite of <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> is {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=unrestricted_admin_mode
|text=Unrestricted Admin Mode
}}, which users can opt in to enable.

In case you are wondering how to fix:

= user-sysmaint-split - Whonix-Workstation versus Whonix-Gateway - Default Installation Status Differences =
This is because, according to the threat model and usage instructions, the user should not use [[Whonix-Gateway]] for anything other than running and configuring Tor. End-user applications, such as a browser, should be run inside [[Whonix-Workstation]]. Therefore, according to our current understanding, <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> would have no security benefit for Whonix-Gateway. As a result, Whonix-Gateway will remain <code>sudo</code> passwordless by default for better usability. Whonix-Workstation will come with <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> installed by default. <ref>
No user applications are running there, besides:

* [[Tor Controller]] (optional, manual start only)
* [[Anon Connection Wizard]] (optional, manual start only)
* [[Tor-control-panel]] (optional, manual start only)
* [[sdwdate-gui]] (runs by default, can be disabled.)

= user-sysmaint-split - GUI vs CLI - Default Installation Status Differences =

<code>user-sysmaint-split</code> is different for the {{gui}} versus the {{cli}} version.

In the future, the CLI version will be improved to be more suitable for servers.

Server support for <code>user-sysmaint-split</code>, however, isn't as sophisticated yet as it is for the GUI version. For some server use cases, <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> may be less needed or unneeded. This topic is elaborated in the development chapter {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=Dev/user-sysmaint-split#Server_Support
|text=<code>user-sysmaint-split</code> Server Support
}}.
