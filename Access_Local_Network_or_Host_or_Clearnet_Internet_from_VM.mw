{{intro|
Advanced documentation detailing the process to connect from inside a VM to a server service running on the host, within the LAN, or clearnet internet.

Consider [[File Transfer]] as a simpler alternative for standard requirements.

This example demonstrates using <code>ssh</code>, but other methods may be substituted accordingly.

== On the Host ==
Install the necessary server software; <code>ssh</code> is illustrated as an example.

{{Install Package|package=ssh}}

If <code>ssh</code> is utilized, its setup on the host (such as public key setup) and related issues are considered prerequisite knowledge and are out of scope for this documentation. This wiki chapter is focused on connectivity, not on server configuration details.

== Inside the VM ==
Install the corresponding client software, e.g., <code>openssh-client</code>.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Install <code>openssh-client</code>.
{{Install Package|package=openssh-client}}

'''2.''' ''Optional:'' Configure a persistent home folder for the user <code>clearnet</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=sudo mkhomedir_helper clearnet}}

'''3.''' Launch a shell under user <code>clearnet</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=sudo -u clearnet bash}}

'''4.''' Disable stream isolation permanently or circumvent it temporarily, as needed.

{{CodeSelect|code=client-software ip-address}}

Note:

* Substitute <code>ssh</code> with your client software of choice.
* Replace <code>192.168.1.0</code> with the actual local LAN IP of the host.
* Remove <code>.anondist-orig</code> if the command isnâ€™t uwt-wrapped by default.
{{CodeSelect|code=ssh.anondist-orig 192.168.1.0}}

'''5.''' Completion.

An SSH connection from within Whonix-Gateway to the host should now be established.

This scenario is currently [[undocumented]] and likely necessitates a complex setup with a high risk of clearnet leaks. See footnote. <ref>
Options could include:
* <u>Less safe</u>: Enabling IP forwarding inside {{project_name_gateway_long}}.
* <u>Safer</u>: [[{{project_name_gateway_short}} Firewall|Opening an Incoming Port on {{project_name_gateway_short}} Firewall]] and running proxy software in {{project_name_gateway_short}} with user <code>clearnet</code> to allow forwarding to the host, LAN, or clearnet Internet.
</ref> Instead, users are recommended to explore [[File_Transfer#SSH_into_{{project_name_gateway_short}}|SSH / SSHFS into {{project_name_gateway_short}}]], [[File_Transfer#SSH_into_{{project_name_workstation_long}}|SSH / SSHFS into {{project_name_workstation_long}}]], and [[sshfs into Whonix-Workstation|SSHFS into {{project_name_workstation_long}}]].

= Troubleshooting =
* Check whether a configured host firewall is blocking connections to the service.
