{{upstream_wiki}}

= Support Status =
[[Unsupported]].

Users are free to experiment with Mullvad Browser inside {{project_name_workstation_short}} but should not assume that {{project_name_short}} developers have tested it in {{project_name_short}} for any purpose.

= {{project_name_short}} Specific =
== General ==
As far as Mullvad Downloader by Kicksecure developers goes:

* No need to deproxy anything. It's really just a downloader. It doesn't do anything unexpected which the user wouldn't do when manually downloading Mullvad Browser. Any files provided by the browser itself are unmodified. No additional settings are applied.

As far as Whonix environment:

* related: [[Tor_Browser#Tor_Browser_Bundle_versus_Whonix_Tor_Browser|Tor Browser Bundle versus Whonix Tor Browser]]
* Why is it related?
* <blockquote>All changes are done through global environmental variable adjustments.</blockquote>
** Search for that quote, see the footnote to see to see the source code files setting the environmental variables.
* It is [[untested]] if/how this environment variables influence Mullvad Browser.

As far as Mullvad Browser goes:

* If in theory Mullvad Browser would have its own proxy and/or VPN enforcement, {{project_name_short}} wouldn't touch, influence that. It would still apply as in any other operating system.
* Same goes for Mullvad DNS settings (DNS over HTTPS (DOH)). [https://mullvad.net/en/help/dns-over-https-and-dns-over-tls#when-to-use Quote Mullvad Browser documentation]:
** <blockquote>The Mullvad Browser uses the Mullvad DNS service (without content blockers) by default.</blockquote>
** <blockquote>We recommend that you use our encrypted DNS service only when you are not connected to Mullvad VPN. When you are connected to Mullvad VPN the DNS queries will be sent through the encrypted VPN tunnel to the DNS server on the Mullvad VPN server that you are connected to, and that is faster.</blockquote>
* Same goes for Mullvad choice or non-choice to block connections to 127.0.0.1 / localhost.
* Questions about how to configure Mullvad Browser should be directed to Mullvad, not {{project_name_short}}.
