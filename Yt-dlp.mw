{{intro|
<code>yt-dlp</code> is a command-line program to download videos from YouTube.com and a few more sites.

<code>yt-dlp</code> is a software fork of <code>youtube-dl</code>.
}}
= Introduction =
<code>yt-dlp</code> is simple to use in {{project_name_short}}. Simply follow the instructions to install it below, identify the relevant YouTube video URL, then run the application in a terminal to download the video. Once it has finished downloading, VLC Media Player (installed by default) can be used to view the video.

= Installation =

The {{project_name_short}} wiki normally recommends that additional software is {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=Install_Software#Install_from_Debian_stable
|text=Installed from Debian stable
}}, but in the case of <code>yt-dlp</code> there is often a significant difference between the stable and current versions. Since the developers frequently update the software to address broken functionality when attempting downloads from various websites, installing <code>yt-dlp</code> from the Python Package Index may be better.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install python3-pip
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
pip install yt-dlp
}}

= Usage =

First identify the relevant YouTube video URL in Tor Browser, then right-click the link and select "Copy Link Location". In the example below it is "Why Do so Many People Hate Windows 10?" (https://youtube.com/watch?v=KpEb8M23LsU)

Finally, open VLC Media Player and select the relevant file to play: <code><u>M</u>edia</code> &rarr; <code><u>O</u>pen File...</code> &rarr; <code>Open the video file</code>
